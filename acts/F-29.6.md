# Summary
Deemed foreign publisher — control For the purpose of this Act, a person who supplies advertising services by means of a periodical that they have the right to produce or publish and who is controlled in any manner by a person or entity that is not a Canadian that results in control in fact, whether directly through the ownership of securities or indirectly through a trust, an agreement, an arrangement or otherwise, is deemed to be a foreign publisher.
Orders If a court concludes, after hearing an application, that the Minister’s demand was justified and that the foreign publisher has failed to comply with it, the court may make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances, including an order to stop supplying advertising services in contravention of section 3 or to otherwise comply with this Act on any terms and conditions that the court considers appropriate; and an order not to take certain specified actions relating to advertising services that might prejudice the ability of a court, on a subsequent application for an order under paragraph (a), to issue an effective order.
