# Summary
Return of rough diamonds if no proceedings If no prosecution under this Act has been instituted on the expiry of the 180-day period, the rough diamonds or other things seized must be returned to their owner or the person having the possession, care or control of them at the time of their seizure.
Application for return If a prosecution under this Act is instituted and rough diamonds or other things have been seized but not forfeited, their owner or the person having the possession, care or control of them at the time of their seizure may apply to the court before which the proceedings are being held for an order that the rough diamonds or other things be returned.
Forfeiture of rough diamonds and other things If a person is convicted of an offence under this Act, the convicting court may, on its own motion or at the request of any party to the proceedings, in addition to any punishment imposed, order the forfeiture to Her Majesty in right of Canada of rough diamonds or other things seized, by means of or in relation to which the offence was committed.
Forfeiture certificate If rough diamonds or other things are forfeited under this Act, the Minister shall provide their former owner or the person having the possession, care or control of them at the time they were seized with a forfeiture certificate.
