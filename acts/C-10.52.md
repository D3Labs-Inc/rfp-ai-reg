# Summary
The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.
The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.
For the purposes of applying subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 to a company that is a resident of Canada, tax payable in Turkey shall include any tax which would have been payable in Turkey in respect of profits attributable to an active business carried on in Turkey for a taxation year, but for an exemption from or reduction of tax granted for that year, or any part thereof, under special tax measures in Turkey insofar as such measures were in force on, and have not been modified since, the date of signature of the Agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character.
