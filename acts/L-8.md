# Summary
Interest on payment and amount of contributions When, at any time after December 31, 1975, a contributor or his or her survivor, estate or succession becomes entitled, pursuant to subsection (1) or (4) or section 8 or 9, to be paid any amount of the contributions made by the contributor under this Part, the President of the Treasury Board shall determine the total amount of contributions that have been made under this Part by the contributor during each year, in this subsection called a "contribution year", in which contributions were made by the contributor; and calculate interest at the rate of four per cent compounded annually on the aggregate amount in respect of each contribution year from December 31 of that year to December 31 of the year immediately preceding the year in which the contributor ceased to hold office as the lieutenant governor of a province.
Idem Where a contributor who has, pursuant to subsection 4(2), ceased to be required to contribute pursuant to subsection 4(1) dies while holding office as the lieutenant governor of a province, his surviving spouse shall be paid a pension equal to one-half of the immediate pension or deferred pension to which the contributor would have become entitled under section 3 had he, immediately prior to his death, ceased, for any reason other than death, to hold office as the lieutenant governor of the province.
