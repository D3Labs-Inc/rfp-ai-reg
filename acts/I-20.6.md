# Summary
Sentence for young person convicted of murder — 12 or 13 years old A Canadian offender who was 12 or 13 years old at the time the offence was committed and whose conduct, if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted first or second degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of the  Criminal Code  is required to serve the sentence imposed by the foreign entity — if less than ten years, in the case of first degree murder, or less than seven years, in the case of second degree murder — consisting, in the same proportion as in paragraph 42(2)(q) of the  Youth Criminal Justice Act , of a committal to custody and a placement under conditional supervision to be served in the community; or the maximum sentence that could be imposed under paragraph 42(2)(q) of that Act if the sentence imposed by the foreign entity was ten years or more in the case of first degree murder or seven years or more in the case of second degree murder.
