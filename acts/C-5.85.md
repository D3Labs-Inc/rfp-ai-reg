# Summary
The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.
Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed at the signing at Berlin on April 19, 2001 of the Agreement between the two States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with respect to Taxes on Income and Certain other Taxes, the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion and the Assistance in Tax Matters, on the following provisions: With reference to Article 4, paragraph 1, it is understood that the term  resident of a Contracting State  includes a person that is liable to tax on world income even if that person is liable to tax on capital only on capital situated in that State.
