# Summary
Director representation and experience The appointment of directors shall be made having regard to the following considerations: the need to ensure, as far as possible, that at all times the board will be representative of persons engaged in the development and demonstration of technologies to promote sustainable development, including technologies to address issues related to climate change and the quality of air, water and soil, the business community, and not-for-profit organizations; the importance of having a board that is representative of various regions of Canada and includes men and women who are able to contribute to the achievement of the objects and purposes of the Foundation; and the need for a board that has sufficient knowledge of technologies that promote sustainable development.
Restrictions on delegation The board shall not delegate any power or right of the board to enact, amend or repeal by-laws; to authorize the provision of funding to eligible recipients for eligible projects; to appoint directors to, or fill vacancies on, a committee of the board; to appoint officers of the Foundation or fix their remuneration; to accept donations; to approve the annual financial statements or reports of the Foundation; or to submit to the members any matter requiring the approval of the members.
