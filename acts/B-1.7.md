# Summary
Idem On the approval of a sale agreement by the Governor in Council the purchasing bank becomes liable instead of the Bank to discharge all obligations of the Bank that have been assumed by the purchasing bank under the agreement; and the agreement is in full force and effect notwithstanding any winding up of the business of the Bank or any order of a court.
Assessor’s duties * (3) As soon as practicable after his appointment, the assessor shall determine as of the day immediately before this Act comes into force, the net realizable value, if any, of the assets less the obligations of the Bank, hereinafter in this section referred to as the “net value”; and any net realizable value of the assets and obligations retained by the Bank under the sale agreement, hereinafter in this section referred to as the “net retained value”.
[Note: Act in force on assent November 27, 1986.] Determination factors In making the determination under subsection (3), the assessor shall take account of all such facts as the assessor deems relevant relating to the circumstances of the Bank including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the likelihood, in the absence of the sale agreement, of profitability and continuing viability of the Bank as an independent bank; of sale of the assets of the Bank other than to the purchasing bank; and of the appointment of a curator or the winding up of the business of the Bank.
