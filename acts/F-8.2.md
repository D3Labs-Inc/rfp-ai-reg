| 12.0 month  | Failure to file return Where a provincial return of operating expenditures for a fiscal year as described in subsection 27(2) has not been submitted to the Secretary of State within 12 months after the end of the fiscal year, the Secretary of State, in determining the operating expenditures for post-secondary education in the province in the fiscal year, shall have recourse to and be guided by such information available to him as he considers appropriate, but in no such case shall the amount determined by the Secretary of State to be equal to 50% of the operating expenditures for post-secondary education in the province in the fiscal year be less than the product obtained by multiplying $15 by the population of the province for the calendar year ending in the fiscal year.

| 1972-04-01 | Limitation on amount of federal contribution Where, for any fiscal year commencing with or after the 1st day of April, 1972, the aggregate of the federal contributions to each of the provinces is greater than 115% of the aggregate of the federal contributions to each of the provinces for the immediately preceding fiscal year, and the federal contribution to a particular province is greater than 115% of the federal contribution to that particular province for the immediately preceding fiscal year, the adjustment payment that may be paid to any one particular province described in paragraph (b) for the fiscal year is an amount determined by the following rules: determine the amount by which the aggregate of the federal contributions to each of the provinces for the fiscal year exceeds 115% of the aggregate of the federal contributions to each of the provinces for the immediately preceding fiscal year; determine, for each particular province described in paragraph (b), the amount by which the federal contribution to that particular province for the fiscal year exceeds 115% of the federal contribution to that particular province for the immediately preceding fiscal year; determine the aggregate of the amounts determined under paragraph (d) for each of the provinces to which that paragraph applies; determine, for each particular province described in paragraph (b), the proportion, as a percentage, that the amount determined under paragraph (d) in the case of that province is of the aggregate determined under paragraph (e); determine, for each particular province described in paragraph (b), the product obtained by multiplying the percentage determined under paragraph (f) in the case of that province by the amount determined under paragraph (c); and the adjustment payment that may be paid to any one particular province described in paragraph (b) for the fiscal year is the amount that, but for this section, would be the adjustment payment payable to that province for the fiscal year minus the amount determined under paragraph (g) in the case of that province.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1972-04-01 | Determination of amount of federal contribution to province for fiscal year For the purpose of applying subsection (1) to determine the adjustment payment that may be paid to a province for the fiscal year commencing with the 1st day of April, 1972, the amount of the federal contribution to a province for any fiscal year is, in the case of the fiscal year commencing with the 1st day of April, 1971, an amount, as determined by the Secretary of State, equal to the aggregate of the adjustment payment that may be paid to the province for that fiscal year, computed under section 13 of the former Act, and the aggregate for that fiscal year determined under paragraph 13(2)(c) of the former Act in the case of the province, and in the case of the fiscal year commencing with the 1st day of April, 1972, an amount, as determined by the Secretary of State, equal to the aggregate of the adjustment payment that, but for this section, would be payable to the province for that fiscal year, and the aggregate for that fiscal year of the amounts determined under paragraphs 23(1)(c), (d) and (e) in the case of the province; and for the purpose of applying subsection (1) to determine the
