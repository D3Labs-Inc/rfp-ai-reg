# Summary
Conditions for validity of notice Notice of dishonour in order to be valid and effectual must be given not later than the juridical or business day next following the dishonouring of the bill; by or on behalf of the holder, or by or on behalf of an endorser, who at the time of giving notice is himself liable on the bill; in the case of the death, if known to the party giving notice, of the drawer or endorser, to a personal representative if there is one and with the exercise of reasonable diligence he can be found; and in case of two or more drawers or endorsers who are not partners, to each of them, unless one of them has authority to receive notice for the others.
Endorser The endorser of a bill by endorsing it, subject to the effect of any express stipulation authorized by this Act, engages that on due presentment it shall be accepted and paid according to its tenor, and that if it is dishonoured he will compensate the holder or a subsequent endorser who is compelled to pay it, if the requisite proceedings on dishonour are duly taken; is precluded from denying to a holder in due course the genuineness and regularity in all respects of the drawer’s signature and all previous endorsements; and is precluded from denying to his immediate or a subsequent endorsee that the bill was, at the time of his endorsement, a valid and subsisting bill, and that he had then a good title thereto.
