| 1912-09-24 | Whereas  from time to time treaties have been made with the Indians for the surrender for various considerations of their personal and usufructury rights to territories now included in the Province of British Columbia, such considerations including the setting apart for the exclusive use of the Indians of certain definite areas of land known as Indian Reserves; And Whereas  the said Indian Reserves were conveyed to the Dominion Government as trustee for the Indians under the terms and conditions set forth in an agreement dated the 24th day of September, 1912, between the Dominion Government and the Province of British Columbia; And Whereas  the precious metals in, upon, or under the lands comprising such Reserves are not incidents of such lands but belong beneficially to the Crown in the right of the Province of British Columbia with the result that the development of all the minerals in, upon or under such lands is at present impractical since the precious and base metals are closely associated and cannot be mined separately; And Whereas  it has been agreed between the Governments of the Dominion of Canada and the Province of British Columbia, that as a matter of policy and convenience and for the development of such minerals and without thereby affecting the constitutional or legal rights of either of the said Governments, the Province of British Columbia should have charge of the development of all minerals and mineral claims both precious and base, in, upon, or under the said Indian Reserves; Now Therefore This Agreement Witnesseth  that the parties have mutually agreed, subject to the approval of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, as follows: Subject as hereinafter in this Agreement provided, the Indian Reserves in the Province of British Columbia shall continue to be administered in accordance with the legislation and agreements now in force. |
