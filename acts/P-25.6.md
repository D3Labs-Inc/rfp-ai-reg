# Summary
Guiding principle In making the selection of a final offer, the arbitrator is to take into account the tentative agreement reached by the employer and the union on February 10, 2012 and the report of the conciliation commissioner dated February 22, 2012 that was released to the parties, and is to be guided by the need for terms and conditions of employment that are consistent with those in other airlines and that will provide the necessary degree of flexibility to ensure the short-and long-term economic viability and competitiveness of the employer; and the sustainability of the employer’s pension plan, taking into account any short-term funding pressures on the employer.
Employer or union If the employer, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers or the Air Canada Pilots Association contravenes any provision of this Act, it is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable, for each day or part of a day during which the offence continues, to a fine of not more than $100,000.
