# Summary
Allocation of underspending from preceding year Where, in the budget for a particular controlled fiscal year, the Minister announces that, on the basis of information relating to expenditures for the controlled fiscal year immediately preceding the particular year received up to the time of the presentation of the budget, it appears that the spending limit for the preceding year, determined without reference to this subsection, will exceed the program spending for the preceding year, the Minister may, in the budget, allocate all or part of that excess to the particular year and, in that event, the spending limit for the particular year shall be increased by the amount so allocated.
Effect of underspending Where the statement in the Public Accounts for a controlled fiscal year indicates that the spending limit for the year exceeds the program spending for the year, the Minister may, in any budget for a controlled fiscal year presented after the publication of the Accounts, allocate all or part of the excess, to the extent that it has not been allocated earlier under subsection 3(2) or this subsection, to such of the following controlled fiscal years as the Minister may determine and announce in that budget and, in that event, the spending limit for each of the following years shall be increased by the amount so allocated to it.
