# Summary
Condition Subject to any express provision in the marine policy, an insurer is not liable for a general average loss or a general average contribution, unless the loss was incurred for the purpose of averting, or in connection with the avoidance of, a peril insured against.
Construction Nothing in sections 66 to 75 shall be construed as affecting the provisions of this Act relating to double insurance or prohibiting an insurer from disproving an interest in whole or in part or from establishing that, at the time of a loss, the whole or any part of the subject-matter insured was not at risk under the marine policy.
Idem Where the subject-matter insured under a marine policy is warranted free from particular average, either wholly or under a specified percentage, the insurer is nevertheless liable for salvage charges and, if the policy contains a sue and labour clause, for particular charges and other expenses properly incurred under the clause for the purpose of averting a loss by a peril insured against.
Idem Where a marine policy insures chartered freight “at and from” a particular place and the ship is not at that place when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches when the ship arrives there in good safety.
