# Summary
Continuation by Governor in Council At any time before a declaration of a public welfare emergency would otherwise expire, the Governor in Council, after such consultation as is required by section 14, may, by proclamation, continue the declaration either generally or with respect to any area of Canada for such period, not exceeding ninety days, as is specified in the proclamation if the Governor in Council believes, on reasonable grounds, that the emergency will continue to exist or that the direct effects of the emergency will continue to extend to that area, as the case may be.
Review of orders and regulations Before issuing a proclamation continuing a declaration of a public welfare emergency, the Governor in Council shall review all current orders and regulations made under section 8 to determine if the Governor in Council believes, on reasonable grounds, that they continue to be necessary for dealing with the emergency and shall revoke or amend them to the extent that they do not so continue.
