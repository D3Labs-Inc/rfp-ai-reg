# Summary
Destruction with consent If an inspector seizes an article under this Act and its owner or the person in whose possession the article was at the time of seizure consents to its destruction, the article is immediately forfeited to Her Majesty and may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the Minister may direct.
Forfeiture If a person is convicted of a contravention of this Act or the regulations, the court or judge may order that any article by means of or in relation to which the offence was committed, and any thing of a similar nature belonging to or in the possession of the person or found with the article, be forfeited.
Order for forfeiture on application of inspector Without prejudice to subsection (2), a judge of a superior court of the province in which any article is seized under this Act may, on the application of an inspector and on any notice to those persons that the judge directs, order that the article and any thing of a similar nature found with it be forfeited to Her Majesty, if the judge finds, after making any inquiry that the judge considers necessary, that the article is one by means of or in relation to which any of the provisions of this Act or the regulations have been contravened.
