# Summary
Appeals  per saltum Subject to sections 39 and 42, an appeal to the Supreme Court lies on a question of law alone with leave of that Court, from a final judgment of the Federal Court or of a court of a province other than the highest court of final resort therein, the judges of which are appointed by the Governor General, pronounced in a judicial proceeding where an appeal lies to the Federal Court of Appeal or to that highest court of final resort, if the consent in writing of the parties or their solicitors, verified by affidavit, is filed with the Registrar of the Supreme Court and with the registrar, clerk or prothonotary of the court from which the appeal is to be taken.
Respondent entitled to costs On the notice referred to in subsection (1) being given, the respondent is at once entitled to the costs of and occasioned by the proceedings in appeal, and may, in the court of original jurisdiction, either sign judgment for those costs or obtain an order from that court or a judge thereof for their payment, and may take all further proceedings in that court as if no appeal had been brought.
