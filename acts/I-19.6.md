# Summary
At the request of not less than twenty-five per cent of the States Parties, Review Conferences of the States Parties shall be convened from time to time by the Depositary, in consultation with the Supervisory Authority, to consider: the practical operation of the Convention as amended by this Protocol and its effectiveness in facilitating the asset-based financing and leasing of the objects covered by its terms; the judicial interpretation given to, and the application made of the terms of this Protocol and the regulations; the functioning of the international registration system, the performance of the Registrar and its oversight by the Supervisory Authority, taking into account the reports of the Supervisory Authority; and whether any modifications to this Protocol or the arrangements relating to the International Registry are desirable.
Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 71(2), a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests: preservation of the aircraft object and its value; possession, control or custody of the aircraft object; immobilisation of the aircraft object; lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), management of the aircraft object and the income therefrom; and if at any time the debtor and the creditor specifically agree, sale and application of proceeds therefrom.
