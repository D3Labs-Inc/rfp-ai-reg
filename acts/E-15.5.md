# Summary
No provision of any collective agreement that is entered into — or of any arbitral award that is made, or of any terms and conditions of employment that are established — after the day on which this Act comes into force may, for any period that begins during the restraint period, change the performance pay plans, including the amounts or rates, that apply to any employees governed by the agreement, award or terms and conditions of employment.
If a provision of a collective agreement that is entered into — or of an arbitral award that is made, or of terms and conditions of employment that are established — during the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on the day on which this Act comes into force changes, for any period that begins during the restraint period, the performance pay plans, including the amounts or rates, that apply to any employees governed by the agreement, award or terms and conditions of employment, the change is of no effect or is deemed never to have had effect, as the case may be.

| 12.0 month | Increases to rates of pay — collective agreements or arbitral awards after coming into force The provisions of any collective agreement that is entered into, or arbitral award that is made, after the day on which this Act comes into force may not provide for increases to rates of pay that are greater than those set out in section  12-month periods For greater certainty, any collective agreement that is entered into, or any arbitral award that is made, after the day on which this Act comes into force and that provides for increases to rates of pay for any period that begins during the restraint period must do so on the basis of a 12-month period.

| 12.0 month | Increases to rates of pay — collective agreements or arbitral awards after coming into force The provisions of any collective agreement that is entered into, or arbitral award that is made, after the day on which this Act comes into force may not provide for increases to rates of pay that are greater than those set out in section  12-month periods For greater certainty, any collective agreement that is entered into, or any arbitral award that is made, after the day on which this Act comes into force and that provides for increases to rates of pay for any period that begins during the restraint period must do so on the basis of a 12-month period.

| 2008-12-08 | No increases to additional remuneration — before December 8, 2008 If a collective agreement that is entered into, or an arbitral award that is made, before December 8, 2008 contains provisions that, for any period that begins in the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on March 31, 2011, provide for an increase to the amount or rate of any additional remuneration that applied to the employees governed by the collective agreement or the arbitral award immediately before the first period that began on or after December 8, 2008, those provisions are of no effect or are deemed never to have had effect, as the case may be.

| 2008-12-08 | No increases to additional remuneration — before December 8, 2008 If a collective agreement that is entered into, or an arbitral award that is made, before December 8, 2008 contains provisions that, for any period that begins in the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on March 31, 2011, provide for an increase to the amount or rate of any additional remuneration that applied to the employees governed by the collective agreement or the arbitral award immediately before the first period that began on or after December 8, 2008, those provisions are of no effect or

| 2008-12-08 | No increases to additional remuneration — before December 8, 2008 If a collective agreement that is entered into, or an arbitral award that is made, before December 8, 2008 contains provisions that, for any period that begins in the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on March 31, 2011, provide for an increase to the amount or rate of any additional remuneration that applied to the employees governed by the collective agreement or the arbitral award immediately before the first period that began on or after December 8, 2008, those provisions are of no effect or

| 2011-03-31 | No increases to additional remuneration — before December 8, 2008 If a collective agreement that is entered into, or an arbitral award that is made, before December 8, 2008 contains provisions that, for any period that begins in the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on March 31, 2011, provide for an increase to the amount or rate of any additional remuneration that applied to the employees governed by the collective agreement or the arbitral award immediately before the first period that began on or after December 8, 2008, those provisions are of no effect or

| 2008-12-08 | No increases to additional remuneration — before December 8, 2008 If a collective agreement that is entered into, or an arbitral award that is made, before December 8, 2008 contains provisions that, for any period that begins in the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on March 31, 2011, provide for an increase to the amount or rate of any additional remuneration that applied to the employees governed by the collective agreement or the arbitral award immediately before the first period that began on or after December 8, 2008, those provisions are of no effect or

2008 changes, for any period that begins in the period that begins on December 8, 2008 and ends on March 31, 2011, the performance pay plans, including the amounts or rates, that apply to any employees governed by the agreement, award or terms and conditions of employment, the change is of no effect or is deemed never to have had effect, as the case may be.

employees governed by the agreement, award or terms and conditions of employment, the change is of no effect or is deemed never to have had effect, as the case may be.

employees governed by the agreement, award or terms and conditions of employment, the change is of no effect or is deemed never to have had effect, as the case may be.
