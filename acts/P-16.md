# Summary
1.

Relief If the judge to whom an application under section 2 is made is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss or hardship as a result of any interruption described in that section, that the applicant took, without avail, such reasonable steps to comply with the time requirement or period of limitation as were open to the applicant, and that the application was made without undue delay, the judge may, after affording to any person who may be affected by any order made pursuant to this section as a result of the application an opportunity to be heard on the application or to make representations in connection therewith, and subject to such conditions, if any, as to the judge seem just, grant relief by order as provided in subsection (2).
