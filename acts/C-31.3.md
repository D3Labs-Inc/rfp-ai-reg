Summit meeting, Recalling the terms of the relevant Resolutions adopted on 31 January 1985 and 20 October 1995 by the European Space Agency (ESA) Council meeting at the ministerial level, and that, within the framework of ESA, and in accordance with its purpose as defined in Article II of the Convention establishing it, the Columbus programme and the European participation in the international Space Station development programme have been undertaken to develop and will develop elements of the civil international Space Station, Recalling Japan’s interest in the Space Station program manifested during the NASA Administrator’s visits to Japan in 1984 and 1985 and Japan’s participation in the U.S. space program through the First Materials Processing Test, Recalling ESA’s and Canada’s participation in the U.S. Space Transportation System through the European development of the first manned space laboratory, Spacelab, and the Canadian development of the Remote Manipulator System, Recalling the partnership created by the Agreement Among the Government of the United States of America, Governments of Member States of the European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, and the Government of Canada on Cooperation in the Detailed Design, Development, Operation, and Utilization of the Permanently Manned Civil Space Station (hereinafter “the 1988 Agreement”), done at
