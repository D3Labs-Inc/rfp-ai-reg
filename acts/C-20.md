# Summary
Avoiding or mitigating unjust result Where, in respect of any person whose Canadian ownership rate is relevant to an application for a certificate or to whom a certificate currently in effect has been issued, the Minister is of the opinion that due to exceptional circumstances the determination of the Canadian ownership rate of that person in accordance with this Act and the regulations would produce or has produced a result that is manifestly unjust to that person in any case, he may, at any time, on his own initiative and without any notice or hearing, make or remake the determination in such manner as, in his opinion, will, as equitably as possible, avoid or mitigate that result, and that determination or redetermination shall be binding on all persons for the purposes of this Act. New certificate to be issued Where the Minister makes a determination or redetermination pursuant to subsection (1), he shall issue a certificate or new certificate accordingly, stating the Canadian ownership rate or the Canadian ownership rate and control status of the applicant, and the effective period of the certificate.
