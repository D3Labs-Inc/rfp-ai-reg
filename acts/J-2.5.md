| 2002-02-15 | Preamble Whereas Canadians and people everywhere are entitled to live their lives in peace, freedom and security; Whereas Parliament recognizes that terrorism is a matter of national concern that affects the security of the nation and considers it a priority to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against Canada and Canadians; Whereas acts of terrorism threaten Canada’s political institutions, the stability of the economy and the general welfare of the nation; Whereas the challenge of eradicating terrorism, with its sophisticated and trans-border nature, requires enhanced international cooperation and a strengthening of Canada’s capacity to suppress and incapacitate acts of terrorism; Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) reaffirms that acts of international terrorism constitute a threat to international peace and security, and reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by acts of terrorism; Whereas Canada ratified the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism on February 15, 2002; Whereas hundreds of Canadians have been murdered or injured in terrorist attacks; Whereas terrorism is dependent on financial and material support; Whereas certain states that support terrorism should not benefit from state immunity in this regard; And whereas Parliament considers that it is in the public interest to enable plaintiffs to bring lawsuits against terrorists and their supporters, which will have the effect of impairing the functioning of terrorist groups in order to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against Canada and Canadians; Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows: Short Title. |
