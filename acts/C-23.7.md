# Summary
Application This Act applies in respect of a victim of an offence in their interactions with the criminal justice system while the offence is investigated or prosecuted; while the offender is subject to the corrections process or the conditional release process in relation to the offence; and while the accused is, in relation to the offence, under the jurisdiction of a court or a Review Board, as those terms are defined in subsection 672.1(1) of the  Criminal Code , if they are found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder or unfit to stand trial.
Interpretation of this Act This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances, and in a manner that is not likely to interfere with the proper administration of justice, including by causing interference with police discretion or causing excessive delay in, or compromising or hindering, the investigation of any offence, and by causing interference with prosecutorial discretion or causing excessive delay in, or compromising or hindering, the prosecution of any offence; interfere with ministerial discretion; interfere with the discretion that may be exercised by any person or body authorized to release an offender into the community; endanger the life or safety of any individual; or cause injury to international relations or national defence or national security.
