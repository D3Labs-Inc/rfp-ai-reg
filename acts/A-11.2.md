# Summary
Powers The Corporation may do any act or thing necessary for, or incidental or conducive to, the carrying out of its purpose and business and affairs related thereto and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation may, including with respect to animals of any distinct breed or evolving breed in respect of which there is no association, keep pedigrees and other records; issue certificates of registration, certificates of identification, embryo certificates, semen certificates and transfers of ownership in respect thereof; and do anything that any association under this Act may lawfully do.
Situation of animal not covered by Act Where, in the course of the examination referred to in section 70, the Minister determines that the animals referred to in an association’s articles of incorporation are not of a distinct breed or of an evolving breed, the Minister shall, by order, direct the association to cease issuing certificates of registration in respect of those animals.
Order of dissolution Where the articles of incorporation of an association that is the subject of an order under subsection (1) directing it to cease issuing certificates of registration in respect of animals of a distinct breed refer only to that distinct breed, the Minister shall by order direct that the association be dissolved in accordance with regulations made pursuant to paragraph 57(b).
