| 15 day     | Whereas by section twenty-one of the  Saskatchewan Act , being chapter forty-two of the four and five Edward the Seventh, it was provided that “All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the Province under the  North-West Irrigation Act, 1898 , shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said Province with the substitution therein of the said Province for the North-West Territories;” And whereas the Government of Canada desires that the Province should be placed in a position of equality with the other provinces of Confederation with respect to the administration and control of its natural resources as from its entry into Confederation in 1905; And whereas the Government of the Province contends that, before the Province was constituted and entered into Confederation as aforesaid, the Parliament of Canada was not competent to enact that the natural resources within the area now included within the boundaries of the Province should vest in the Crown and be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada and was not entitled to administer the said natural resources otherwise than for the benefit of the residents within the said area, and moreover that the Province is entitled to be and should be placed in a position of equality with the other Provinces of Confederation with respect to its natural resources as from the fifteenth day of July, 1870, when Rupert’s Land and the North-Western Territory were admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada: And whereas it has been agreed between Canada and the said Province that the said section of the  Saskatchewan Act  should be modified and that provision should be made for the determination of the respective rights and obligations of Canada and the Province as herein set out; Now Therefore This Agreement Witnesseth: Transfer of Public Lands Generally. |

| 1870-07-01 | Whereas by section twenty-one of the  Saskatchewan Act , being chapter forty-two of the four and five Edward the Seventh, it was provided that “All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the Province under the  North-West Irrigation Act, 1898 , shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said Province with the substitution therein of the said Province for the North-West Territories;” And whereas the Government of Canada desires that the Province should be placed in a position of equality with the other provinces of Confederation with respect to the administration and control of its natural resources as from its entry into Confederation in 1905; And whereas the Government of the Province contends that, before the Province was constituted and entered into Confederation as aforesaid, the Parliament of Canada was not competent to enact that the natural resources within the area now included within the boundaries of the Province should vest in the Crown and be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada and was not entitled to administer the said natural resources otherwise than for the benefit of the residents within the said area, and moreover that the Province is entitled to be and should be placed in a position of equality with the other Provinces of Confederation with respect to its natural resources as from the fifteenth day of July, 1870, when Rupert’s Land and the North-Western Territory were admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada: And whereas it has been agreed between Canada and the said Province that the said section of the  Saskatchewan Act  should be modified and that provision should be made for the determination of the respective rights and obligations of Canada and the Province as herein set out; Now Therefore This Agreement Witnesseth: Transfer of Public Lands Generally. |
