| (100000, 'USD') | Whereas  pursuant to paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union between the Dominion of Canada and the then Colony of British Columbia and to certain statutes of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, being chapter eleven of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty, chapter fourteen of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-three, and chapter fourteen of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-four, there were granted by the Province to Canada certain Crown lands in the Province by way of consideration for Canada’s undertaking to secure the construction of a railway to connect the seaboard of the Province with the railway system of Canada and of Canada’s paying to the Province from the date of the Union an annual sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the said Crown lands being defined in the statutes aforesaid and having become known as the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block; And whereas  a railway such as is described in paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union has been duly constructed and is in operation, and the Province has requested the re-transfer to it of such of the lands in the said Railway Belt and Peace River Block as remain unalienated; And whereas  the Honourable W. M. Martin, one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Saskatchewan, having by Order in Council dated the eighth day of March, 1927 (P.C. 422) been appointed a commissioner under Part One of the  Inquiries Act  to receive and inquire into the arguments of the Government of the Province of British Columbia in support of its claim for the reconveyance of the said lands to the Province, submitted his report as such commissioner in which he expressed the opinion that the Province could not by reason of its own agreements and statutes advance any legal claim, but that its request should be considered from the standpoint of fairness and justice rather than from the strictly legal and contractual position, and in which he recommended that the said lands should be restored; And whereas  Canada has agreed accordingly to re-transfer the said lands to the Province on the terms hereinafter set out. |
| (100000, 'USD') | Notwithstanding the re-transfer of the hereinbefore recited lands, Canada will continue to pay annually to the Province, by half-yearly payments on the first days of January and July in each year, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, as provided in paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union aforesaid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 20 day     | Made this twentieth day of February, 1930. between: The Government of The Dominion of Canada , represented herein by the Honourable Ernest Lapointe, Minister of Justice, and the Honourable Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior, of the First Part, and The Government of the Province of British Columbia , represented herein by the Honourable Simon Fraser Tolmie, Premier and Minister of Railways of the said Province, and the Honourable Frederick Parker Burden, Minister of Lands thereof, of the Second Part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8 day      | Whereas  pursuant to paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union between the Dominion of Canada and the then Colony of British Columbia and to certain statutes of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, being chapter eleven of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty, chapter fourteen of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-three, and chapter fourteen of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-four, there were granted by the Province to Canada certain Crown lands in the Province by way of consideration for Canada’s undertaking to secure the construction of a railway to connect the seaboard of the Province with the railway system of Canada and of Canada’s paying to the Province from the date of the Union an annual sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the said Crown lands being defined in the statutes aforesaid and having become known as the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block; And whereas  a railway such as is described in paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union has been duly constructed and is in operation, and the Province has requested the re-transfer to it of such of the lands in the said Railway Belt and Peace River Block as remain unalienated; And whereas  the Honourable W. M. Martin, one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Saskatchewan, having by Order in Council dated the eighth day of March, 1927 (P.C. 422) been appointed a commissioner under Part One of the  Inquiries Act  to receive and inquire into the arguments of the Government of the Province of British Columbia in support of its claim for the reconveyance of the said lands to the Province, submitted his report as such commissioner in which he expressed the opinion that the Province could not by reason of its own agreements and statutes advance any legal claim, but that its request should be considered from the standpoint of fairness and justice rather than from the strictly legal and contractual position, and in which he recommended that the said lands should be restored; And whereas  Canada has agreed accordingly to re-transfer the said lands to the Province on the terms hereinafter set out. |

| 1927-03-01 | Whereas  pursuant to paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union between the Dominion of Canada and the then Colony of British Columbia and to certain statutes of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, being chapter eleven of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty, chapter fourteen of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-three, and chapter fourteen of the statutes of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-four, there were granted by the Province to Canada certain Crown lands in the Province by way of consideration for Canada’s undertaking to secure the construction of a railway to connect the seaboard of the Province with the railway system of Canada and of Canada’s paying to the Province from the date of the Union an annual sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the said Crown lands being defined in the statutes aforesaid and having become known as the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block; And whereas  a railway such as is described in paragraph eleven of the Terms of Union has been duly constructed and is in operation, and the Province has requested the re-transfer to it of such of the lands in the said Railway Belt and Peace River Block as remain unalienated; And whereas  the Honourable W. M. Martin, one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Saskatchewan, having by Order in Council dated the eighth day of March, 1927 (P.C. 422) been appointed a commissioner under Part One of the  Inquiries Act  to receive and inquire into the arguments of the Government of the Province of British Columbia in support of its claim for the reconveyance of the said lands to the Province, submitted his report as such commissioner in which he expressed the opinion that the Province could not by reason of its own agreements and statutes advance any legal claim, but that its request should be considered from the standpoint of fairness and justice rather than from the strictly legal and contractual position, and in which he recommended that the said lands should be restored; And whereas  Canada has agreed accordingly to re-transfer the said lands to the Province on the terms hereinafter set out. |
| 1930-02-03 | Nothing in this agreement shall extend to the lands included within Indian reserves in the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block, but the said reserves shall continue to be vested in Canada in trust for the Indians on the terms and conditions set out in a certain order of the Governor General of Canada in Council approved on the 3rd day of February, 1930 (P.C. 208).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
