# Summary

Signing instruments and acts An instrument or act referred to in this section granting federal real property or conceding federal immovables, other than letters patent, shall be signed by the Minister having the administration of the property.
Transfers of administration and control An instrument transferring administration and control of federal real property or an act transferring administration and control of federal immovables to Her Majesty in any right other than Canada pursuant to regulations made under paragraph 16(2)(e) shall be signed by the Minister having the administration of the property and countersigned by the Minister of Justice.
A grant, concession, vesting order or other conveyancing instrument or transfer act in favour of Her Majesty in respect of any real property or immovable belonging to Her Majesty in any right other than Canada results, on its acceptance, in Her Majesty having administration and control of the property.
