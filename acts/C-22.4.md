# Summary
Preamble WHEREAS an Association known as the Canadian Red Cross Society has been in operation for some years past, and was actively engaged during the late war in South Africa in contributing funds and tending the sick and wounded; and whereas the said association was in affiliation with the Society in England known as "The National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in War", and the work, operations and powers of the last named Society have now been transferred to and are being carried on, under the patronage of His Majesty King Edward the Seventh, by the British Red Cross Society, with which the Canadian Red Cross Society has now become affiliated; and whereas the International Conference of Geneva of 1863 recommended: "That there should exist in every country a Committee whose mission consists in co-operating in times of war with the hospital service of the armies by all means in its power"; and whereas it is expedient that there should be a permanent organization in Canada in affiliation with the British Red Cross Society to carry out the purposes of the said treaty, and especially to secure supplies and to execute the humane objects contemplated by the said treaty, with the power to adopt and use the distinctive flag and badge specified by the said treaty in Article 7, on which shall be the sign of the Red Cross, and for the purpose of co-operating with the "Comité International de Secours aux Militaires Blessés"; and whereas it is expedient that the existing association in Canada should be incorporated for the purposes aforesaid: Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:— Incorporation Corporate name His Honour Colonel John Morrison Gibson, Lieutenant Governor of the province of Ontario; Sir Louis H.
