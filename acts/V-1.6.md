# Summary
Subsection 19(2) of the  Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act  is replaced by the following: Refusal to establish review panel The Chairperson, or any member to whom the Chairperson has delegated the authority, may refuse to establish a review panel to hear an application for review of a decision concerning the amount of an award under the  Pension Act , or the amount of a critical injury benefit, pain and suffering compensation, additional pain and suffering compensation, a death benefit, a clothing allowance or a detention benefit under Part 3 of the  Veterans Well-being Act , if the Chairperson or member, as the case may be, considers the application to be such that no reasonable review panel could dispose of it in a manner favourable to the applicant.
Subsection 34(1) of the Act is replaced by the following: Application for compassionate award A person who has been refused an award under the  Pension Act  or a critical injury benefit, a disability award, pain and suffering compensation, additional pain and suffering compensation, a death benefit, a clothing allowance or a detention benefit under Part 3 of the  Veterans Well-being Act , and who has exhausted all procedures for review and appeal under this Act may apply to the Board for a compassionate award.
