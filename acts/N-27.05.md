# Summary
Supplementary report The Auditor General of Canada may, at any time, inquire into and submit a supplementary report to the Legislative Assembly about any matter relating to the activities of the Government of the Northwest Territories, including whether accounts have not been faithfully and properly maintained or public money has not been fully accounted for or paid, if so required by law, into the Consolidated Revenue Fund; essential records have not been maintained or the rules and procedures applied have been insufficient to safeguard and control public property, to secure an effective check on the assessment, collection and proper allocation of the revenue and to ensure that expenditures have been made only as authorized; money has been expended for purposes other than those for which it was appropriated by the Legislature or has been expended without due regard to economy or efficiency; or satisfactory procedures have not been established to measure and report the effectiveness of programs, if such procedures could appropriately and reasonably be implemented.
