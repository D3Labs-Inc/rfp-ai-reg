# Summary
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this article, an insurance enterprise resident in a Contracting State shall, except in regard to reinsurance, be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State if it collects premiums in the territory of that other State or insures risks situated therein through a person other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 7 applies.
The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.
In the case of Colombia, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: Where a resident of a Colombia derives income or owns elements of capital which, under this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, Colombia shall, subject to the limitations of its domestic laws, allow: as a deduction ( descuento ) from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in the other State; as a deduction ( descuento ) from the tax on the capital of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the other State on those elements of capital; and as a deduction ( descuento ) from the corporate income tax effectively paid by a company that pays out dividends, an amount corresponding to the profits out of which such dividends are paid.
