# Summary
Decision of judge The judge before whom a person is brought following arrest under section 13 or 16 shall if the person has been arrested on the request of the International Criminal Court, order the detention in custody of the person unless the person shows cause, in accordance with subsection 522(2) of the  Criminal Code , that their detention in custody is not justified, and the judge is satisfied that, given the gravity of the alleged offence, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances that justify release — with or without conditions — and that the person will appear as required; or in any other case, order the release, with or without conditions, or detention in custody of the person.
Date of hearing — provisional arrest If a person has been provisionally arrested, the judge before whom the person is brought shall order the person to appear before the court from time to time during the period referred to in paragraph 14(1)(b) or (c); and set a date for the extradition hearing if the Minister has issued an authority to proceed.
Order of detention for temporary surrender Subject to subsection (2), a judge shall, on application of the competent authority made at any time before the temporary surrender, order the detention in custody of a person who is serving a term of imprisonment or has otherwise lawfully been deprived of their liberty in a requested State or entity and whose temporary surrender Canada has requested for the purpose of prosecution or appeal.
