# Summary
Removal or destruction of unlawful imports An inspector who has reasonable grounds to believe that an imported thing has been imported in contravention of a provision of this Act or the regulations, is a pest, is or could be infested with a pest or constitutes or could constitute a biological obstacle to the control of a pest or that a requirement imposed by or under the regulations in respect of an imported thing has not been met may, by notice, whether the thing is seized or not, order its owner or importer or the person having possession, care or control of it to remove it from Canada or, if removal is not possible, to destroy it.
Limitation No compensation is payable under subsection (1) in respect of a thing that is imported into Canada or exported from Canada in contravention of this Act or the regulations or a thing that is found to be a pest, to be infested with a pest or to constitute a biological obstacle to the control of a pest when it is inspected on importation or exportation; or the prohibition or restriction of the sale or movement of a thing where the sale or movement is prohibited or restricted as a result of an amendment, suspension or revocation of, or a refusal to issue or renew, a permit, certificate or other document that is required under this Act or the regulations.
