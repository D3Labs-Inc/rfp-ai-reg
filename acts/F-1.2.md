# Summary
Considerations In making an order under this section, the court must consider, among other things, the best interests of any children who habitually reside in the family home, including the interest of any child who is a First Nation member to maintain a connection with that First Nation; the terms of the will; the terms of any agreement between the spouses or common-law partners; the collective interests of First Nation members in their reserve lands and the representations made by the council of the First Nation on whose reserve the family home is situated with respect to the cultural, social and legal context that pertains to the application; the medical condition of the survivor; the period during which the survivor has habitually resided on the reserve; the fact that the family home is the only property of significant value in the estate; the interests of any person who holds or will hold an interest or right in or to the family home; the interests of any elderly person or person with a disability who habitually resides in the family home and for whom the survivor is the caregiver; the existence of exceptional circumstances that necessitate the removal of a person from the family home in order to give effect to the granting to the survivor of exclusive occupation of that home, including the fact that the person has committed acts or omissions that constitute family violence, or reasonably constitute psychological abuse, against the survivor, any child in the charge of the survivor, or any other family member who habitually resides in the family home; and the views of any person who received a copy of the application, presented to the court in any form that the court allows.
