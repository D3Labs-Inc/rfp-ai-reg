| 2018-05-21 | In the case of Iceland, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: where a resident of Iceland derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, may be taxed in Canada, Iceland shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (b) and (c), exempt such income or capital from tax; where a resident of Iceland derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 or 21, may be taxed in Canada, Iceland shall allow as a deduction from the tax on income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in Canada; such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from Canada; where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of Iceland is exempt from tax in Iceland, Iceland may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital. |
