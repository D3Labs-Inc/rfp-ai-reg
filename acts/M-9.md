# Summary
Company to give notice of defects affecting fuel consumption Where a company has been convicted of an offence for contravening section 6 or subsection 19(1) on the basis of paragraph 6(1)(e) or 19(1)(e), as the case may be, and the convicting court is of the opinion that the dissimilarity was in the nature of a defect the result of which is that the registered fuel consumption number does not correctly represent the fuel consumption of that motor vehicle, the court may order the company to give notice forthwith, in the prescribed manner, containing a statement of the means to be taken to correct the defect at the company’s expense, to the person who has obtained that motor vehicle from the company for the purpose of sale or resale; the current owner of that motor vehicle as determined from any warranty by the manufacturer, distributor or importer of that motor vehicle with respect to the functioning of that motor vehicle that has, to the company’s knowledge, been given, sold or transferred to the current owner, or from provincial motor vehicle registration records; and the Minister.
