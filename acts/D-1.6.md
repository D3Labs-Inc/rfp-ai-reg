# Summary
Depository note A depository note is an unconditional promise in writing that is signed by the maker, promising to pay, at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to, or to the order of, a specified person; marked prominently and legibly on its face and within its text, at or before the time of issue, with the words "This is a depository note subject to the  Depository Bills and Notes Act " or "Billet de dépôt assujetti à la  Loi sur les lettres et billets de dépôt "; not marked with any words prohibiting negotiation, transfer or assignment of it or of an interest in it; made payable, originally or by endorsement, to a clearing house; and deposited with the clearing house to which it is made payable.
For the purposes of sections 13, 14 and 15, a depository bill or a depository note whose order or promise to pay is limited to payment from the assets of a partnership, unincorporated association, trust or estate is not dishonoured by its acceptor, drawer or maker if that person provides funds to the clearing house to which it is payable in accordance with the order or promise to pay and section 17.
