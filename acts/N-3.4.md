# Summary
Preamble WHEREAS it is desirable in the public interest of Canada to acquire and preserve the great historic battlefields at Quebec, restoring so far as possible their principal features, so as to make them a Canadian National Park; Whereas considerable portions of these grounds are already vested in His Majesty for the military or other public purposes of Canada; Whereas it is anticipated that, in addition to the appropriation of public moneys of Canada hereby authorized, the various provincial governments, as well as municipal or other bodies, and many private individuals, will contribute generously to the aforesaid project; And whereas it is expedient to provide for the constitution of a commission for the acquisition, management and control, subject to the provisions of this Act, of the said battlefields and the moneys contributed for the said purposes; Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows: Constitution of Commission The Governor in Council may appoint seven Commissioners, who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor in Council, and who, with any additional Commissioners who may be appointed under the authority of this Act, shall be a body politic and corporate under the name of “The National Battlefields Commission”.
