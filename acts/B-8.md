# Summary
Postponement if the bridge is reported unsafe Where the engineer reports pursuant to subsection (1) that, in his opinion, the bridge would, by reason of incompleteness or insufficiency, be dangerous to the public using it, the Minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, may order the company to whom the bridge belongs to postpone the opening for a period not exceeding one month.
Further inspection The Minister may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, from time to time thereafter, on further inspection of the bridge by an engineer directed under subsection (1) after the ten days notice given under paragraph 4(b), and on a report from the engineer as to the incompleteness or insufficiency of the bridge, make a like order for postponement of the opening of the bridge until it appears to the Minister that the opening of the bridge may take place without danger to the public.
Omitting to report accidents Every company that wilfully omits to give to the Minister the notice of an accident on or to its bridge required by this Act shall incur a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for every day during which the omission to give the notice continues.
