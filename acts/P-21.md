| 30 day     | Extension of time limits The head of a government institution may extend the time limit set out in section 14 in respect of a request for a maximum of thirty days if meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the government institution, or consultations are necessary to comply with the request that cannot reasonably be completed within the original time limit, or such period of time as is reasonable, if additional time is necessary for translation purposes or for the purposes of converting the personal information into an alternative format, by giving notice of the extension and the length of the extension to the individual who made the request within thirty days after the request is received, which notice shall contain a statement that the individual has a right to make a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner about the extension.

| 30 day     | Extension of time limits The head of a government institution may extend the time limit set out in section 14 in respect of a request for a maximum of thirty days if meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the government institution, or consultations are necessary to comply with the request that cannot reasonably be completed within the original time limit, or such period of time as is reasonable, if additional time is necessary for translation purposes or for the purposes of converting the personal information into an alternative format, by giving notice of the extension and the length of the extension to the individual who made the request within thirty days after the request is received, which notice shall contain a statement that the individual has a right to make a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner about the extension.
