| 1 year        | Details in certificates and memorials Despite any law of Canada or of a province, in any certificate in respect of a debtor, any memorial evidencing a certificate or any writ or document issued for the purpose of collecting an amount certified, it is sufficient for all purposes to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor, the total of amounts payable by the debtor without setting out the separate amounts making up that total; and to refer to the rate of interest or penalty to be charged on the separate amounts making up the amount payable in general terms in the case of interest, as interest at the prescribed rate under this Part applicable from time to time on amounts payable to the Receiver General, without indicating the specific rates of interest to be charged on each of the separate amounts or to be charged for any period; and in the case of a penalty, the penalty calculated under section  Garnishment If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a person is, or will be within one year, liable to make a payment to another person that is liable to pay an amount under this Part (in this section referred to as a “debtor”), the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the person to pay without delay, if the money is immediately payable, and in any other case, as and when the money is payable, the money otherwise payable to the debtor in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1992-05-09 | Preamble Whereas there is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change; Whereas recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are at the highest level in history and present an unprecedented risk to the environment, including its biological diversity, to human health and safety and to economic prosperity; Whereas impacts of climate change, such as coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security are already being felt throughout Canada and are impacting Canadians, in particular the Indigenous peoples of Canada, low-income citizens and northern, coastal and remote communities; Whereas Parliament recognizes that it is the responsibility of the present generation to minimize impacts of climate change on future generations; Whereas the United Nations, Parliament and the scientific community have identified climate change as an international concern which cannot be contained within geographic boundaries; Whereas Canada has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, done in New York on May 9, 1992, which entered into force in 1994, and the objective of that Convention is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system; Whereas Canada has also ratified the Paris Agreement, done in Paris on December 12, 2015, which entered into force in 2016, and the aims of that Agreement include holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to achieving Canada’s Nationally Determined Contribution – and increasing it over time – under the Paris Agreement by taking comprehensive action to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy, accelerate clean economic growth and build resilience to the impacts of climate change; Whereas it is recognized in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change that climate change is a national problem that requires immediate action by all governments in Canada as well as by industry, non-governmental organizations and individual Canadians; Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing is a core element of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change; Whereas behavioural change that leads to increased energy efficiency, to the use of cleaner energy, to the adoption of cleaner technologies and practices and to innovation is necessary for effective action against climate change; Whereas the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions on a basis that increases over time is an appropriate and efficient way to create incentives for that behavioural change; Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing reflects the “polluter pays” principle; Whereas some provinces are developing or have implemented greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems; Whereas the absence of greenhouse gas emissions pricing in some provinces and a lack of stringency in some provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems could contribute to significant deleterious effects on the environment, including its biological diversity, on human health and safety and on economic prosperity; And whereas it is necessary to create a federal greenhouse gas emissions pricing scheme to ensure that, taking provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems into account, greenhouse gas emissions pricing applies broadly in Canada;

| 2015-12-12 | Preamble Whereas there is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change; Whereas recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are at the highest level in history and present an unprecedented risk to the environment, including its biological diversity, to human health and safety and to economic prosperity; Whereas impacts of climate change, such as coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security are already being felt throughout Canada and are impacting Canadians, in particular the Indigenous peoples of Canada, low-income citizens and northern, coastal and remote communities; Whereas Parliament recognizes that it is the responsibility of the present generation to minimize impacts of climate change on future generations; Whereas the United Nations, Parliament and the scientific community have identified climate change as an international concern which cannot be contained within geographic boundaries; Whereas Canada has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, done in New York on May 9, 1992, which entered into force in 1994, and the objective of that Convention is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system; Whereas Canada has also ratified the Paris Agreement, done in Paris on December 12, 2015, which entered into force in 2016, and the aims of that Agreement include holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to achieving Canada’s Nationally Determined Contribution – and increasing it over time – under the Paris Agreement by taking comprehensive action to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy, accelerate clean economic growth and build resilience to the impacts of climate change; Whereas it is recognized in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change that climate change is a national problem that requires immediate action by all governments in Canada as well as by industry, non-governmental organizations and individual Canadians; Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing is a core element of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change; Whereas behavioural change that leads to increased energy efficiency, to the use of cleaner energy, to the adoption of cleaner technologies and practices and to innovation is necessary for effective action against climate change; Whereas the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions on a basis that increases over time is an appropriate and efficient way to create incentives for that behavioural change; Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing reflects the “polluter pays” principle; Whereas some provinces are developing or have implemented greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems; Whereas the absence of greenhouse gas emissions pricing in some provinces and a lack of stringency in some provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems could contribute to significant deleterious effects on the environment, including its biological diversity, on human health and safety and on economic prosperity; And whereas it is necessary to create a federal greenhouse gas emissions pricing scheme to ensure that, taking provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems into account, greenhouse gas emissions pricing applies broadly in Canada;

| 2018-03-01 | Natural gas that contains biomethane Unless subsection (8) applies, if a quantity of marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas contains a particular proportion of biomethane (expressed as a percentage), for the purpose of this Part, the quantity of marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas is deemed to be the number of cubic metres determined by the formula A × (100% – B) where A is the number of cubic metres that the marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas would occupy at 15°C and 101.325 kPa; and B is the particular proportion.

| 2018-03-01 | Natural gas that contains biomethane Unless subsection (8) applies, if a quantity of marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas contains a particular proportion of biomethane (expressed as a percentage), for the purpose of this Part, the quantity of marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas is deemed to be the number of cubic metres determined by the formula A × (100% – B) where A is the number of cubic metres that the marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas would occupy at 15°C and 101.325 kPa; and B is the particular proportion.

| 2018-03-01 | Natural gas that contains biomethane Unless subsection (8) applies, if a quantity of marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas contains a particular proportion of biomethane (expressed as a percentage), for the purpose of this Part, the quantity of marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas is deemed to be the number of cubic metres determined by the formula A × (100% – B) where A is the number of cubic metres that the marketable natural gas or non-marketable natural gas would occupy at 15°C and 101.325 kPa; and B is the particular proportion.
