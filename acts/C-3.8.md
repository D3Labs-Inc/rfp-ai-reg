# Summary
Role of advisory board The role of the advisory board is to advise the Minister on any matter within the object of the Agency, including the types of projects that are most likely to result in significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and advance the competitiveness and efficiency of Canadian industry; and market conditions relating to eligible domestic credits and eligible Kyoto units.
Advance payment for eligible domestic credits The Agency may, with the approval of the Treasury Board, make payments to acquire eligible domestic credits before they are created if the Agency exercises due diligence and the credits are to be created in relation to a project that meets criteria established by the Minister; the Minister is satisfied that it is reasonable to expect that the project will result in reductions or removals of greenhouse gases in the amounts anticipated in the agreement relating to the acquisition; and the agreement relating to the acquisition contains a provision requiring the repayment of the proportion of the amounts advanced for which no credits are received by the Agency.
Form and contents The annual report must include the financial statements of the Agency, prepared in accordance with accounting principles consistent with those applied in preparing the Public Accounts referred to in section 64 of the  Financial Administration Act , and the Auditor General of Canada’s opinion on them; information about the Agency’s performance with respect to the objectives established in the corporate business plan; and any other information that the Minister may require to be included in it.
