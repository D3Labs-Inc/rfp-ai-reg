Canada and Ontario may enter into an agreement or agreements for the confirmation of patents issued or other dispositions of land by the other with respect to land, but no such agreement or confirmation shall in any way affect the rights of any band or the recourse which any band would, absent such agreement, have against any person or land, including the Crown and Crown lands.
A specific agreement shall come into force when it is confirmed by Orders in Council of both Canada and Ontario and is confirmed by the band.
