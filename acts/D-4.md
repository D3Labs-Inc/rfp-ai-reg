# Summary
Amount of subsidies for first class docks The subsidy in respect of dry docks of the first class that have been constructed under this Act shall be a sum not exceeding four and one-half per cent per annum of the cost of the work as fixed and determined under section 8, payable half-yearly during a period not exceeding thirty-five years from the time the Governor in Council has determined under this Act that the work has been completed.
Payment of subsidy When the amount actually expended for the work and the materials on or for the dock has equalled at least seventy-five per cent of the cost thereof as fixed and determined under section 8, and the Minister has certified thereto and has further certified that the work has been done to the Ministerâ€™s satisfaction, half-yearly payments on account of the subsidy at the rate of four and one-half per cent per annum may be made on ninety per cent of the cost of all work done and materials provided at the time of the payment, but in all other respects this Act applies to the issue of any bonds, debentures or other securities and to any payments on account of the subsidy during construction of the dock.
