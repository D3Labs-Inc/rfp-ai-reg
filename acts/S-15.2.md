# Summary
Amounts to be credited to Account There shall be credited to the Registered Pension Plans Account in each fiscal year in respect of every month, an amount equal to the amount estimated by the Minister to be required to provide for the cost of the benefits that have accrued in respect of that month and that will become chargeable against the Account; and an amount representing interest on the balance from time to time to the credit of the Account, calculated at the same rates and credited in the same manner and at the same time as interest is calculated and credited in respect of the Superannuation Account continued under subsection 4(2) of the  Public Service Superannuation Act .
Recovery of amounts paid in error Subject to the regulations, where an amount is paid in error under a special pension plan or retirement compensation arrangement on account of any benefit payable on a periodic basis, the Minister may authorize the retention, by way of deduction from any subsequent payment of that benefit, of the amount paid in error, together with interest at the prescribed rate or determined in the prescribed manner, from the time the amount was paid in error, and any charge prescribed in respect thereof, without prejudice to any other recourse available to Her Majesty in right of Canada with respect to the recovery thereof.
