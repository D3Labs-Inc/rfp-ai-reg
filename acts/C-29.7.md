# Summary
Charging principles The Corporation shall observe the following principles when establishing a new charge for air navigation services or revising an existing charge: charges must be in accordance with a methodology established and published by the Corporation that is explicit and that also includes the terms and conditions affecting charges; charges must not be structured in such a way that a user would be encouraged to engage in practices that diminish safety for the purpose of avoiding a charge; charges for the same services must not differentiate between domestic and international flights of air carriers; charges for the same services must not differentiate among Canadian air carriers or among foreign air carriers; charges must differentiate between the provision of services in relation to the landing and take-off of aircraft and the provision of services in relation to aircraft in flight, and must reflect a reasonable allocation of the costs of providing the services in those circumstances; charges in respect of recreational and private aircraft must not be unreasonable or undue; charges for designated northern or remote services and for services directed to be provided under subsection 24(1) must not be higher than charges for similar services utilized to a similar extent elsewhere in Canada; charges must be consistent with the international obligations of the Government of Canada; and charges must not be set at a level that, based on reasonable and prudent projections, would generate revenues exceeding the Corporationâ€™s current and future financial requirements in relation to the provision of civil air navigation services.
