# Summary
However, such interest may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is a company which is the beneficial owner of the interest, the tax so charged shall not exceed: 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest arising in Brazil and paid to a resident of Canada in respect of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation of Canada for a minimum period of 7 years; 15 per cent in all other cases.
Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other independent activities of a similar nature shall be taxable only in that State, unless the payment of such activities and services is borne by a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State or a company resident therein.
This Convention shall not apply to International Organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic, consular or permanent mission of a third State, being present in a Contracting State and not treated in either Contracting State as resident in respect of taxes on income.
