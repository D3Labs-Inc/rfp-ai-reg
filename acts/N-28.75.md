| 60.0 day   | Request for ministerial exemption If the Commission determines that the initiative is not in conformity with an applicable land use plan, the department or agency may request an exemption from the federal Minister or the territorial Minister, or both, taking into account their respective jurisdictions, within 60 days after that determination, if the land use plan does not authorize the granting of a minor variance or if it does and the conditions are not met; or the Commission’s decision to refuse to grant a minor variance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 120.0 day  | Ministerial decision The Minister or Ministers, as the case may be, must, within 120 days after the day on which they receive a request under subsection (1), either grant the exemption, in which case the Commission must make the decision public and send the proposal relating to the initiative to the Board in order for the Board to conduct a screening; or refuse the exemption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1993-07-09 | 90675 Preamble Whereas Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area have entered into a land claims agreement that came into force on July 9, 1993 on its ratification by both parties; And whereas the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Nunavut Impact Review Board were established under that agreement, which provides that the substantive powers, functions, duties and objectives of those institutions of public government must be set out in statute; And whereas it is desirable to set out a regime for land use planning and project assessment that recognizes the importance of responsible economic development and conservation and protection of the ecosystems and that encourages the well-being and self-reliance of the Inuit and other residents of the designated area, taking into account the interests of all Canadians; Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows: Short Title.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
