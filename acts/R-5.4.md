# Summary
An amendment concerning a condition contemplated by subsection  Suspension of licence The Minister may suspend a licence in whole or in part for a period of up to 90 days if the Minister is satisfied that the continued operation of a licensed system is likely to be injurious to national security, the defence of Canada, the safety of Canadian Forces or Canada’s conduct of international relations; or inconsistent with Canada’s international obligations.
Measures ordered on suspension or termination of licence The Minister may make an order requiring a person whose licence is suspended or cancelled or has expired to take any measures related to the operation of the remote sensing space system that the Minister considers advisable, having regard to national security, the defence of Canada, the safety of Canadian Forces, Canada’s conduct of international relations and Canada’s international obligations; and the system disposal plan, including its provisions for the protection of the environment, public health and the safety of persons and property.

| 30.0 day   | Contents of notice The Minister may establish the form and content of notices of violation, but each notice of violation must name the person believed to have committed a violation; identify the violation; set out the penalty that the enforcement officer proposes to impose; inform the person that they may, within 30 days after the notice is served or within any longer period specified in the notice, either pay the penalty set out in the notice or make representations to the officer with respect to the alleged violation or proposed penalty — including any representations about entering into a compliance agreement — and set out the manner for doing so; and inform the person that, if they do not pay the penalty or make representations in accordance with the notice, they will be considered to have committed the violation and the officer may impose a penalty in respect of it. |
| 5 year     | Criteria for penalty The amount of a proposed penalty is, in each case, to be determined taking into account the following matters: the degree of intention or negligence on the part of the person who committed the violation; the harm done by the violation; the person’s history of prior violations or convictions under this Act during the five-year period immediately before the violation; any prescribed criteria; and any other relevant matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1 day      | Continuing violation A violation that is committed or continued on more than one day constitutes a separate violation for each day on which it is committed or continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
