# Summary
The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Party, carries on business in the other Party in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.
For the purposes of Articles 6 (Income from Immovable Property) and 7 (Business Profits), a Party shall not, after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after seven years from the end of the taxable period to which the income concerned was attributed, make a primary adjustment to the income of a resident of one of the Parties where that income has been charged to tax in the other Party in the hands of that resident.
It is understood that the term “earnings” in paragraph 6 of Article 10 (Dividends) does not include business profits attributable to a permanent establishment in a Party or income from the trading of immoveable property in a Party that have been re-invested in that Party as determined in accordance with the law of that Party.
