# Summary
Contractual language The arbitrator’s decision must be drafted in a manner that constitutes a new collective agreement between the employer and the union and, to the extent that it is possible, incorporate the contractual language that is referred to in paragraph 10(1)(a) and that is in the final offer selected by the arbitrator.
New collective agreement Subject to section 15 and despite anything in Part I of the  Canada Labour Code , the arbitrator’s decision constitutes a new collective agreement between the employer and the union that is effective beginning on the day on which it is made and that binds the parties until January 31, 2015.
Amendments Nothing in this Act is to be construed so as to limit or restrict the rights of the parties to agree to amend any provision of the new collective agreement, other than its term as provided for in subsection 14(1) or the salary increases referred to in section 15, and to give effect to the amendment.
