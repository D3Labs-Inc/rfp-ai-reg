# Summary
Every operator who is conducting an onshore geophysical operation shall ensure that detonator lead wires remain shunted at all times except when the charges are ready to be fired and during circuit testing after loading; all blasting equipment at the blasting site is under the direct supervision and control of the shooter; when conducting a blasting operation in the vicinity of buildings, railways, roads or inhabited areas, the shooter takes adequate precautions to prevent any damage to property, and places warning signs or barricades or uses flagpersons to ensure that no persons other than those engaged in the blasting operation remain in the area made dangerous by the blasting operation; when blasting operations are being carried out, the shooter takes adequate precautions to ensure that no charge is fired until all persons in the vicinity of the charge are protected by suitable cover from falling rocks, flying debris, mud and any other material disturbed or displaced as a result of the detonation or are at a safe distance from the charge; detonators that are used near the surface of the ground are covered in such a manner that any fragments of metal and debris resulting from the detonation are confined; a radio transmitter is not used at or near a blasting site when there are detonators outside of a magazine and above ground; all blasting equipment is maintained in good working condition; repair work to blasting equipment or to the firing cable is not conducted while the firing cable is wired to charges; the blasting equipment is disconnected from the blasting circuit and the ends of the lead wires connected to the charge are twisted together immediately after firing, if the charge fails to detonate, and before any member of the geophysical crew inspects any shot hole that contains or may contain explosives; every detonator remains disconnected from the firing cable until the next charge or the next series or pattern of charges is ready to be fired and until the shotpoint is clear of all persons; all shot holes containing a charge are fired before the termination of the operation; blasting operations are not carried out during an electrical storm or when an electrical storm is imminent; anti-static detonators are used where possible for all blasting operations; and all electric detonator lead wires and other refuse from the blasting operation are retrieved from the field location of the operation.

| 30.0 day   | Every operator who is conducting an onshore geophysical operation shall, once a charge is loaded into a shot hole, ensure that the detonator lead wires remain shunted at all times except during circuit testing; detonation of the charge occurs within 30 days after the day on which the charge is loaded into the shot hole, or any longer period approved by a conservation officer; and in inhabited areas or areas where there is the possibility that the detonator lead wires or detonating cord of the charge may be tampered with, a temporary plug is placed in the shot hole and the ground in the vicinity of the shot hole is levelled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
