# Summary
Where a contributor has become entitled under these Regulations to an annuity or an annual allowance the monthly instalments of which would amount to less than $10 each, there may be paid to that contributor, upon request by him to the Minister in writing within three months from the time when he became so entitled, an amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) to be the capitalized value of the said annuity, which payment shall be in lieu of any other benefit under these Regulations.
Where a contributor who has undergone a medical examination in accordance with subsection (2) is certified by the Medical Services Branch, National Capital Zone of the Department of National Health and Welfare, to have regained his health or to be capable of performing the duties of an agent, payment of the annuity shall be suspended but shall be resumed, subject to these Regulations, at such time as he reaches 65 years of age, or again becomes disabled.
