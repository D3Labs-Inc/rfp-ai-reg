# Summary
For the purpose of subsection 21(2) of the Act, the prescribed information for the register of members is the name of each member; the current residential or business address of each member; an email address if the member has consented to receiving information or documents by electronic means; for each person named in the register, the date on which that person became a member and, if applicable, the date on which that person ceased to be a member; and the class or group of membership of each member, if any.
Despite section 44, a corporate name that is confusing with the name of a body corporate that has not carried on activities in the two years immediately before the day on which the Director receives the documents referred to in section 9 or 201 or subsection 208(4), 211(5), 215(5), 216(6) or 219(3) of the Act or a request to reserve a name under subsection 12(1) of the Act is not prohibited for that reason alone if the body corporate has been dissolved; or in the case of a body corporate that has not been dissolved, it consents in writing to the use of the name and undertakes in writing to dissolve immediately or to change its name before the corporation that proposes to use the name begins using it.
