No owner or lessee of land to which these Regulations apply shall permit an object of natural growth that is on that land to grow to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 3.
Pearson International Airport Zoning Plan No. 21-005 94-138, Sheets 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33, 40, 41, 42, 43, 48, 49 and 50 dated July 31, 1995, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary plane located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1995-07-31 | The outer surface, shown on Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport Zoning Plan No. 21-005 94-138, Sheets 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33, 40, 41, 42, 43, 48, 49 and 50 dated July 31, 1995, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary plane located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
