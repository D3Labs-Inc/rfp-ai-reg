# Summary
For the purposes of section 4, where the agricultural product in respect of which an application is made is ready for sale at the place where it is usually sold by the applicant, the monetary value of the agricultural product shall be deemed to be the market value that the product would have had if it had been sold at the place where it is usually sold on the date of the notice referred to in paragraph 3(f).
For the purposes of section 4, where the agricultural product in respect of which an application is made is at an incomplete stage of production or marketing and is not ready for sale at the place where it is usually sold by the applicant, the monetary value of the agricultural product shall be the market value that the product would have had at the place where the product is usually sold if it had been ready for sale and sold at that place on the date of the notice referred to in paragraph 3(f), minus the amount assessed by the Minister or a person designated by him as the amount by which the market value described in paragraph (a) should be reduced because the product is at an incomplete stage of production or marketing.
