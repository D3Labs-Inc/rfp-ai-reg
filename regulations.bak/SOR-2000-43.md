# Summary
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations.
2000-79 Whereas, pursuant to subsection 48(1) of the  Canadian Environmental Protection Act a , the Minister of the Environment published in the  Canada Gazette , Part I, on June 5, 1999, a copy of the proposed  Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations , substantially in the annexed form, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection; R.S., c.
No retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall use or offer for use a nozzle to dispense gasoline or a gasoline blend into an on-road vehicle if the flow rate from the nozzle exceeds 38 L/min.
A person shall determine the flow rate referred to in section 3 by measuring the amount of time it takes to dispense 10.0 L of gasoline or a gasoline blend from the nozzle with the nozzle operated at the maximum flow rate.
