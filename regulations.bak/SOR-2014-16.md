# Summary
Prohibition — interference A person must not use or develop, or permit another person to use or develop, any of the lands that are under the outer surface in a manner that causes interference with any signal or communication to and from an aircraft or to and from any facility used to provide services relating to aeronautics.
The airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan, is the geometric centre of the runway thresholds, at grid coordinates 7 069 965.22 N, 521 899.94 E (latitude 63°45′23.67089″ N, longitude 68°33′22.01292″ W).
The strip surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary rectangular surface described as follows: the strip surface associated with runway 17-35 is 300.00 m in total width, being 150.00 m on either side of the centre line of the runway.
Threshold 17 is defined as the northwestern limit of the existing runway surface and intersects with the centre line of the runway at grid coordinates 7 070 894.76 N and 520 975.59 E.
Threshold 35 is defined as the southeastern limit of the existing runway surface and intersects with the centre line of the runway at grid coordinates 7 069 035.68 N and 522 824.29 E.

# Summary
Prohibition — interference A person must not use or develop, or permit another person to use or develop, any of the lands that are under the outer surface in a manner that causes interference with any signal or communication to and from an aircraft or to and from any facility used to provide services relating to aeronautics.
The airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan, is the geometric centre of the runway thresholds, at grid coordinates 7 069 965.22 N, 521 899.94 E (latitude 63°45′23.67089″ N, longitude 68°33′22.01292″ W).
The strip surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary rectangular surface described as follows: the strip surface associated with runway 17-35 is 300.00 m in total width, being 150.00 m on either side of the centre line of the runway.
Threshold 17 is defined as the northwestern limit of the existing runway surface and intersects with the centre line of the runway at grid coordinates 7 070 894.76 N and 520 975.59 E.
Threshold 35 is defined as the southeastern limit of the existing runway surface and intersects with the centre line of the runway at grid coordinates 7 069 035.68 N and 522 824.29 E.
