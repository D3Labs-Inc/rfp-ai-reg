# Summary
For the purposes of paragraph 68.16(6)(a) of the Act, if a person has purchased gasoline in respect of which the excise tax imposed under Part III of the Act has been paid and the person has recovered any of the cost of the gasoline from a person described in any of paragraphs 68.16(1)(g.1) to (g.3) of the Act, the amount that shall be paid under subsection 68.16(1) of the Act in respect of the purchase shall be calculated by multiplying $0.015 by the number of litres of gasoline purchased at a price that includes the excise tax.
For the purposes of paragraph 68.16(6)(b) of the Act, if a person has purchased gasoline in respect of which the excise tax imposed under Part III of the Act has been paid and the person has recovered any of the cost of the gasoline from a person described in any of paragraphs 68.16(1)(g.1) to (g.3) of the Act, the person who purchased the gasoline is deemed to be the purchaser of the gasoline.
Despite subsection (1), if the cost was recovered as a reimbursement from a person referred to in paragraph 68.16(1)(g.1) or (g.2) of the Act and the reimbursement was made because the person was the employer of the person who purchased the gasoline, the reimburser is deemed to be the purchaser of the gasoline.
