# Summary
Information A road authority must provide a railway company, in writing, with the following information in respect of a public grade crossing: the precise location of the grade crossing; the number of traffic lanes that cross the crossing surface; the average annual daily traffic; the road crossing design speed; the specifications set out in columns A, B and C of Table 10-2 of the Grade Crossings Standards to which the road approach corresponds, taking into account the characteristics set out for rural roads in Table 10-3 of those Standards or the characteristics set out for urban roads in Table 10-4 of those Standards, as applicable; the width of each traffic lane and shoulder on the road approach; the design vehicle; the stopping sight distance; the average gradient of the road approach; the crossing angle referred to in article 6.5 of the Grade Crossings Standards; the applicable departure time referred to in article 10.3 of the Grade Crossings Standards; the activation time referred to in article 18.2 of the Grade Crossings Standards; the time referred to in article 19.3(a) of the Grade Crossings Standards; and an indication of whether the grade crossing includes a sidewalk, path or trail, and if so, whether the sidewalk, path or trail has been designated for persons using assistive devices.
Stop and proceed Despite sections  105  and  106 , if railway equipment must stop before proceeding across a public grade crossing that is located in an area referred to in section  104  and that is used by motor vehicles, a warning system with flashing lights and bells must be installed at the grade crossing and must meet the applicable standards set out in articles 12 to 16 of the Grade Crossings Standards; or the railway company must manually protect the grade crossing.
