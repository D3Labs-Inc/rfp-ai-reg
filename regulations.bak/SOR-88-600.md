| 8 hour      | An ADS supervisor shall ensure that a pilot supervised by the supervisor does not remain underwater, in any 24 hour period, for more than a total of eight hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30.0 minute | No diving supervisor shall permit a diver supervised by the supervisor to make a dive that is part of a diving operation from a place referred to in paragraph 6(1)(b) that is unsuitable; a craft that has insufficient power or stability for the safe conduct of the dive; a dive site located more than 2 m above the water unless a suitable skip, diving bell or diving submersible is used to transport the diver through the air-water interface; a dynamically positioned craft unless the craft has been operating in the dynamically positioned mode for at least 30 minutes before the diver enters the water, the range of surge or sway movement of the water at the dive site is less than 80 per cent of the maximum operational capacity limit of the craft, a skip or a diving bell is positioned as close as possible to the diver’s underwater work site, all reasonable precautions are taken to prevent any umbilical used in the dive from coming into contact with any propeller or manoeuvring unit of the craft, any change of heading or positioning of the craft, at any time a diver involved in the diving operation is in the water, is made only after the diving supervisor has granted permission for the change and the diver has been notified, and the craft complies with the requirements of section 25; and a craft that is under way, except in the case of an emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 12.0 hour   | A diving supervisor shall take all reasonable precautions to ensure that, except in the event of the evacuation of a diver during a diving operation supervised by the diving supervisor, a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a dive does not fly in an aircraft for 12 hours following a non-decompression dive, for 24 hours following decompression, or for such longer period as the diving supervisor considers necessary to ensure that the diver does not suffer decompression sickness; and a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a saturation dive remains under observation in the general area of the decompression chamber for at least 24 hours after decompression or such longer period as is sufficient in the opinion of the diving supervisor to ensure the well-being of the diver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 30.0 minute | Where a person involved in a diving operation is in a compression chamber, the supervisor of the diving operation shall keep a record or ensure that a record is kept, at regular intervals of not more than 30 minutes, of the time and the depth gauge readings and of the main components of the atmosphere in the compression chamber, including the oxygen and carbon dioxide; and the temperature and humidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 14.0 day    | No diver shall make a saturation dive unless in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of 14 days’ duration or less, at least 14 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression; and in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of more than 14 days’ duration, at least 28 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14.0 day    | No diver shall make a saturation dive unless in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of 14 days’ duration or less, at least 14 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression; and in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of more than 14 days’ duration, at least 28 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 28.0 day    | No diver shall make a saturation dive unless in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of 14 days’ duration or less, at least 14 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression; and in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of more than 14 days’ duration, at least 28 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

of section 14; is designed and constructed in accordance with an acceptable standard; provides a suitable environment for its occupants, including amenities appropriate to the type, depth and duration of the diving operation; is equipped with doors that act as pressure seals and that can be opened from both the inside and the outside; is designed to minimize the risk of fire and is constructed of only non-combustible or fire-resistant materials, and is equipped with suitable firefighting capabilities; is fitted with adequate equipment, including facilities for supplying to and maintaining for its occupants an appropriate breathing mixture, lighting and heating the compression chamber, and removing carbon dioxide; is equipped with valves, gauges and other fittings necessary to indicate and control the internal pressures of each compartment from outside the compression chamber; is fitted with piping that has at least one external shut-off valve, where practicable, immediately outside the point at which the piping enters the compression chamber and one internal shut-off valve immediately inside that point; is fitted with hull integrity valves that clearly indicate whether the valves are in the open or closed position and that are clearly labelled by name and number; other than a diving bell and the compression chamber of a diving submersible, is equipped with a built-in breathing system that permits outside dumping of exhaled gas; where appropriate, is equipped with an emergency shut-off valve that automatically shuts off the flow of gas from the compression chamber if the velocity or volume of gas exceeds the preset limit; is equipped with relief valves resistant to marine corrosion; has all of its internal electrical wiring insulated and in conduit, except for the wiring for low-power devices such as telephones; is cleaned and disinfected using only products that are recommended by the manufacturer for that type of use, well proven for that purpose, non-toxic at any pressure, non-corrosive, and safe to use; where used in a category II dive or a category III dive or, where practicable, in a category I dive, is provided with a coupling arrangement that is suitable for the safe transfer of persons under pressure and that is designed to prevent accidental release; is provided with a clamping mechanism that is suitable for coupling a diving bell with the surface compression chamber, clearly indicates when the clamping mechanism is fully engaged, and cannot be disengaged while pressurized; is supplied with breathing mixture through a gas control panel that has distinct indicators of the function of each valve and gauge, and is designed so as to minimize the possibility of supplying an incorrect breathing mixture; if manufactured after December 31, 1990, is fitted with a device to record continuously and to preserve at least the last recorded four hours of data respecting temperature, oxygen levels, depth, time and oral communications and, where practicable, carbon dioxide and humidity levels, and where practicable, is provided with a means to permit video monitoring of its occupants; and if manufactured on or before December 31, 1990, meets the requirements set out in paragraph (r) where the Minister so determines pursuant to paragraph 3.2(1)(b) of the Act.

| 1990-12-31 | No diving contractor who conducts a diving operation shall use or permit to be used a diving bell in the diving operation unless the diving bell meets the requirements of sections 14 and 15; is equipped to permit the safe transfer of persons under pressure to and from a surface compression chamber; is of a design that provides for an internal space of at least 2 m 3  for two-person occupancy and 3 m 3  for three-person occupancy, enables divers to enter and exit without difficulty, and allows at least two divers dressed-in for a diving operation to be seated comfortably therein; is equipped with valves, gauges and other fittings necessary to control the internal pressure and to indicate both inside the diving bell and at the diving station the internal and external pressures; is so equipped that any valve used to pressurize the diving bell is spring-loaded so as to close when not held in the open position; contains adequate equipment, including reserve facilities, for supplying the appropriate breathing mixture to persons occupying or working from the diving bell, which reserve facilities shall be protected against inadvertent operation and be capable of being brought on-line from inside the diving bell without the assistance of any other person; is equipped with a two-way oral communication system by means of which a person inside the diving bell can communicate with the diving supervisor of the diving operation and, via the diving supervisor, with other persons; contains equipment for lighting and heating the diving bell; is equipped with suitable emergency life-support equipment and provisions for each occupant of the diving bell; is equipped with a lifting device sufficient to enable an unconscious or injured diver to be hoisted into the diving bell by a person located in it; is provided with lifting equipment that enables the diving bell to be lowered to the depth at which the diving operation is to be conducted, to be maintained in its position and to be raised, all without excessive lateral, vertical or rotational movement; is provided with a means whereby, in the event of the failure of the lifting equipment referred to in paragraph (k), the diving bell can be returned to the surface and, where that means involves the shedding of weights, the controls for that shedding can be operated from within the diving bell, and a means is incorporated to prevent the accidental shedding of those weights; in addition to a primary lifting cable, is equipped with a suitable tag rope so designed that, in the event the primary cable breaks during a water-air interface transport, the tag rope will not permit the diving bell to descend to a depth greater than 25 m; is equipped with a secondary lifting eye, or similar device that is of at least the same strength as the primary lifting eye, and is provided with a secondary lifting cable that is readily available and that has at least the same strength as the primary lifting cable and is compatible with the secondary lifting eye or similar device; is fitted with equipment to enable occupants of the diving bell to monitor the temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels within the diving bell; is equipped with a stroboscopic light that is automatically activated in the water and a pinger that operates at a frequency of 37.5 kHz; where the Minister so determines pursuant to paragraph 3.2(1)(b) of the Act, is fitted with a relocation transponder system that operates at a frequency of 37.5 kHz; where appropriate, is fitted with hull integrity valves and non-return valves on all gas and, where practicable, hot-water circuits connected to the diving bell; if manufactured after December 31, 1990, is so designed that, if necessary, a diver within the diving bell can disconnect or shear the primary lifting cable and the umbilical, disconnect or shear any other attachments that might prevent ascent, start, accelerate, decelerate or stop the ascent, and where practicable, start, accelerate, decelerate or stop the descent, and is fitted with a device to record continuously and to preserve at least the last recorded four hours of data respecting temperature, oxygen levels, depth, time, oral communications, internal and external ambient pressure, and the quantity of breathing mixture and electrical power available for use in an

| 1990-12-31 | No diving contractor who conducts a diving operation shall use or permit to be used a diving bell in the diving operation unless the diving bell meets the requirements of sections 14 and 15; is equipped to permit the safe transfer of persons under pressure to and from a surface compression chamber; is of a design that provides for an internal space of at least 2 m 3  for two-person occupancy and 3 m 3  for three-person occupancy, enables divers to enter and exit without difficulty, and allows at least two divers dressed-in for a diving operation to be seated comfortably therein; is equipped with valves, gauges and other fittings necessary to control the internal pressure and to indicate both inside the diving bell and at the diving station the internal and external pressures; is so equipped that any valve used to pressurize the diving bell is spring-loaded so as to close when not held in the open position; contains adequate equipment, including reserve facilities, for supplying the appropriate breathing mixture to persons occupying or working from the diving bell, which reserve facilities shall be protected against inadvertent operation and be capable of being brought on-line from inside the diving bell without the assistance of any other person; is equipped with a two-way oral communication system by means of which a person inside the diving bell can communicate with the diving supervisor of the diving operation and, via the diving supervisor, with other persons; contains equipment for lighting and heating the diving bell; is equipped with suitable emergency life-support equipment and provisions for each occupant of the diving bell; is equipped with a lifting device sufficient to enable an unconscious or injured diver to be hoisted into the diving bell by a person located in it; is provided with lifting equipment that enables the diving bell to be lowered to the depth at which the diving operation is to be conducted, to be maintained in its position and to be raised, all without excessive lateral, vertical or rotational movement; is provided with a means whereby, in the event of the failure of the lifting equipment referred to in paragraph (k), the diving bell can be returned to the surface and, where that means involves the shedding of weights, the controls for that shedding can be operated from within the diving bell, and a means is incorporated to prevent the accidental shedding of those weights; in addition to a primary lifting cable, is equipped with a suitable tag rope so designed that, in the event the primary cable breaks during a water-air interface transport, the tag rope will not permit the diving bell to descend to a depth greater than 25 m; is equipped with a secondary lifting eye, or similar device that is of at least the same strength as the primary lifting eye, and is provided with a secondary lifting cable that is readily available and that has at least the same strength as the primary lifting cable and is compatible with the secondary lifting eye or similar device; is fitted with equipment to enable occupants of the diving bell to monitor the temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels within the diving bell; is equipped with a stroboscopic light that is automatically activated in the water and a pinger that operates at a frequency of 37.5 kHz; where the Minister so determines pursuant to paragraph 3.2(1)(b) of the Act, is fitted with a relocation transponder system that operates at a frequency of 37.5 kHz; where appropriate, is fitted with hull integrity valves and non-return valves on all gas and, where practicable, hot-water circuits connected to the diving bell; if manufactured after December 31, 1990, is so designed that, if necessary, a diver within the diving bell can disconnect or shear the primary lifting cable and the umbilical, disconnect or shear any other attachments that might prevent ascent, start, accelerate, decelerate or stop the ascent, and where practicable, start, accelerate, decelerate or stop the descent, and is fitted with a device to record continuously and to preserve at least the last recorded four hours of data respecting temperature, oxygen levels, depth, time, oral communications, internal and external ambient pressure, and the quantity of breathing mixture and electrical power available for use in an emergency and, where practicable, carbon dioxide and humidity levels; and if manufactured on or before December 31, 1990, meets the requirements set out in paragraph (s) where the Minister so determines pursuant to paragraph 3.2(1)(b) of the Act.

| 2018-12-01 | A diving supervisor shall take all reasonable precautions to ensure that, except in the event of the evacuation of a diver during a diving operation supervised by the diving supervisor, a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a dive does not fly in an aircraft for 12 hours following a non-decompression dive, for 24 hours following decompression, or for such longer period as the diving supervisor considers necessary to ensure that the diver does not suffer decompression sickness; and a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a saturation dive remains under observation in the general area of the decompression chamber for at least 24 hours after decompression or such longer period as is sufficient in the opinion of the diving supervisor to ensure the well-being of the diver.
