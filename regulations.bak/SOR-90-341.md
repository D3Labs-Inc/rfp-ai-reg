# Summary
The concentration of asbestos fibres referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) shall be measured dry and undiluted, under normal operating conditions, in accordance with the applicable method described in  Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurements of Emissions of Asbestos from Mining and Milling Operations ; Department of Fisheries and Environment Report EPS-1-AP-75-1 dated December 1976, as amended from time to time.
Where, pursuant to section 5, the Minister requests samples of gas streams released into the ambient air from a mine or mill and such related information as will enable the Minister to cause analyses to be made of the concentration of asbestos fibres in the gas streams, the owner or operator of the mine or mill shall obtain the samples at regular six month intervals in accordance with the appropriate method described in  Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Asbestos from Mining and Milling Operations ; Department of Fisheries and Environment Report EPS-1-AP-75-1 dated December 1976, as amended from time to time and shall forthwith submit the samples and related information to the Minister.
