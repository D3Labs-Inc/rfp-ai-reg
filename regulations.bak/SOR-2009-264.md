# Summary
2009-1535 Whereas, pursuant to subsection 332(1) a  of the  Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 b , the Minister of the Environment published in the  Canada Gazette , Part I, on April 26, 2008, a copy of the proposed  Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings Regulations , substantially in the annexed form, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the proposed Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection; S.C. 2004, c.
Sale or offer for sale A person must not sell or offer for sale any architectural coating set out in column 1 of the schedule if its VOC concentration exceeds the limit set out in column 2 for that product unless dilution of the coating before its use is required and in accordance with the written instructions of the manufacturer, importer or seller, to a VOC concentration equal to or less than that limit set out in column 2 and that coating is either labelled with or accompanied by those instructions in both official languages; or the coating was manufactured or imported under a permit issued under section 10 and the sale or offer for sale occurs no later than two years after the day on which the permit expires.
