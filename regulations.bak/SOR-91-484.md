| 1987-02-23 | 2033-1 dated February 23, 1987, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 2033-01-01 | 2033-1 dated February 23, 1987 are described as follows: the transitional surfaces associated with runway 07-25 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip or to an elevation of 54.805 m above sea level; the transitional surfaces associated with runway 11-29 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip or to an elevation of 54.805 m above sea level; and the transitional surfaces associated with runway 16-34 are vertical planes rising from the lateral limits of the strip to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip or to an elevation of 54.805 m above sea level.

| 2018-11-29 | 2033-1 dated February 23, 1987 are described as follows: the transitional surfaces associated with runway 07-25 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip or to an elevation of 54.805 m above sea level; the transitional surfaces associated with runway 11-29 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip or to an elevation of 54.805 m above sea level; and the transitional surfaces associated with runway 16-34 are vertical planes rising from the lateral limits of the strip to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip or to an elevation of 54.805 m above sea level.
