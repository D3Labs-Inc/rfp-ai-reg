The outer surface, shown on Ross River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2995, dated December 30, 1992, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The strip associated with runway 08-26, shown on Ross River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2995, dated December 30, 1992, is 90 m in width, 45 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 796.4 m in length.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Ross River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2995, dated December 30, 1992, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
