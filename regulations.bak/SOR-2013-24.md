| (500.0, 'GBP')    | Work factor The work factor for each vehicle subconfiguration is calculated using the formula 0.75 × (GVWR – curb weight + xwd) + 0.25 × (GCWR – GVWR) where GVWR is the GVWR as defined in subsection  1 (1), expressed in pounds; curb weight is the curb weight as defined in subsection  1 (1), expressed in pounds; xwd is 500 pounds if the vehicle has four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and is 0 pounds for all other vehicles; and GCWR is the GCWR as defined in subsection  1 (1), expressed in pounds.

| (0.0, 'GBP')      | Work factor The work factor for each vehicle subconfiguration is calculated using the formula 0.75 × (GVWR – curb weight + xwd) + 0.25 × (GCWR – GVWR) where GVWR is the GVWR as defined in subsection  1 (1), expressed in pounds; curb weight is the curb weight as defined in subsection  1 (1), expressed in pounds; xwd is 500 pounds if the vehicle has four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and is 0 pounds for all other vehicles; and GCWR is the GCWR as defined in subsection  1 (1), expressed in pounds.

| (21.0, 'GBP')     | CO 2  emission standard Subject to subsections (7) and (8), every tractor and incomplete tractor of the 2014 and subsequent model years must have a CO 2  emission rate that does not exceed the applicable CO 2  emission standard set out in the following table for the model year in question for the applicable useful life of the tractor: Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Item Class of Tractor Characteristics CO 2  Emission Standard (grams of CO 2  per tonne-mile) for the 2014 to 2016 Model Years CO 2  Emission Standard (grams of CO 2  per tonne-mile) for the 2017 and

demonstrate compliance The CO 2  emission rate must be determined using the GEM computer simulation model with the following parameters: the “regulatory subcategory” referred to in the GEM computer simulation model corresponds to a type of tractor referred to in any of subparagraphs  18 (3)(a)(v) to (xiii), whichever applies to the tractor being modelled; the coefficient of aerodynamic drag determined in accordance with subsection (4); the steer tire rolling resistance level and the drive tire rolling resistance level measured for each tire configuration in accordance with section 520(c) of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart F, of the CFR; in the case of a tractor equipped with a vehicle speed limiter, the maximum speed, expressed in miles per hour and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mile per hour, to which the tractor is limited, determined in accordance with section 640 of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart G, of the CFR; the weight reduction value, calculated by adding the applicable values set out in the tables in the following subparagraphs: in the case of tires and wheels, the weight reduction value corresponds to the sum of the applicable weight reduction values set out in column 3 for each of the tractor’s wheels that are set out in the following table: Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Item Tire Type Wheel Type Weight Reduction Value (pounds per wheel) 1 Single-wide drive tire Steel wheel 84 2 Single-wide drive tire Aluminum wheel 139 3 Single-wide drive tire Light-weight aluminum wheel (weighs at least 9.5 kg (21 pounds) less than a similar steel wheel) 147 4 Steer tire or dual-wide drive tire High-strength steel wheel (steel with tensile strength of 350 MPa or more) 8 5 Steer tire or dual-wide drive tire Aluminum wheel 21 6 Steer tire or dual-wide drive tire Light-weight aluminum wheel (weighs at least 9.5 kg (21 pounds) less than a similar steel wheel) 30 in the case of the following components, the weight reduction value corresponds to the sum of the applicable weight reduction values for each of the tractor’s components that are set out in the following table: Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Item Component

of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart F, of the CFR; in the case of a tractor equipped with a vehicle speed limiter, the maximum speed, expressed in miles per hour and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mile per hour, to which the tractor is limited, determined in accordance with section 640 of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart G, of the CFR; the weight reduction value, calculated by adding the applicable values set out in the tables in the following subparagraphs: in the case of tires and wheels, the weight reduction value corresponds to the sum of the applicable weight reduction values set out in column 3 for each of the tractor’s wheels that are set out in the following table: Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Item Tire Type Wheel Type Weight Reduction
