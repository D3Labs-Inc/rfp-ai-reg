# Summary
Responsibilities of representative The responsibilities of a designated representative include deciding whether to retain counsel and, if counsel is retained, instructing counsel or assisting the represented person in instructing counsel; making decisions regarding the claim or application or assisting the represented person in making those decisions; informing the represented person about the various stages and procedures in the processing of their case; assisting in gathering evidence to support the represented person’s case and in providing evidence and, if necessary, being a witness at the hearing; protecting the interests of the represented person and putting forward the best possible case to the Division; informing and consulting the represented person to the extent possible when making decisions about the case; and filing and perfecting an appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division, if required.
Factors In deciding the application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including whether the party is residing in the location where the party wants the proceeding to be held; whether a change of location would allow the proceeding to be full and proper; whether a change of location would likely delay the proceeding; how a change of location would affect the Division’s operation; how a change of location would affect the parties; whether a change of location is necessary to accommodate a vulnerable person; and whether a hearing may be conducted by a means of live telecommunication with the claimant or protected person.
