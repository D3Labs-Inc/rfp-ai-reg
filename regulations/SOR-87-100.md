# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheet 5, dated October 24, 1984, is a point distant 100 m measured southwesterly at right angles to the centre line of runway 17-35, from a point distant 900 m measured northwesterly along the said centre line from the southeasterly end of said runway.
The outer surface, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 1 to 9, dated October 24, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, in which case the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, dated October 24, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2011-08-10 | The approach surfaces, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 13 dated October 24, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 17-35 and 10-28 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 17 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 35 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 10 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 280 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 62.5 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 28 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 280 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 62.5 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-01-09 | The outer surface, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 1 to 9, dated October 24, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, in which case the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1984-10-24 | The outer surface, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 1 to 9, dated October 24, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, in which case the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 2005-02-04 | Each transitional surface, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, dated October 24, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1984-10-24 | Each transitional surface, shown on Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090-83-26, Sheets 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, dated October 24, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
