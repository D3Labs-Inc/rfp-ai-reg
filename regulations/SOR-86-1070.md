# Summary
No registrar shall approve a land registry plan unless the plan accurately and clearly identifies, by the CRINA number, any rights or interests in the Category IA or IA-N land shown on the plan or in the buildings situated on that land that are fully registered pursuant to these Regulations as of the date of the deposit of the plan; and depicts the location of the boundaries of the land or buildings or both, that are the subject of the rights and interests referred to in paragraph (a).
Where the registration of a right or interest has been confirmed under subsection 25(3) but the territorial description of the right or interest is not depicted on a survey confirmed in accordance with Part II of the  Canada Lands Surveys Act , or the appropriate local land registrar or the central land registrar is not satisfied that the boundaries of the land or building, or both, that are the subject of the right or interest can be easily located on the ground, the right or interest shall be considered to be provisionally registered pursuant to these Regulations as of the hour the document evidencing the right or interest was accepted under subsection 24(1) and that provisional registration shall be noted in the appropriate index books and depicted on the relevant land registry plans.
