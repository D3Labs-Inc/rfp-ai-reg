| 1984-11-23 | 1690 dated November 23, 1984 are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 06-24 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 06 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 24 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip;
