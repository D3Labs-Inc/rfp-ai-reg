| 30.0 day   | Cessation of activities A holder of a licence that intends to cease conducting all the activities authorized by the licence — whether before or on the date of expiry of the licence — must provide the Minister with a written notice to that effect at least 30 days before the day on which those activities cease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
