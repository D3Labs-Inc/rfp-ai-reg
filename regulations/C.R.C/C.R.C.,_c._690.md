# Summary
Materiel, having been provided for national defence purposes, shall not be loaned except as prescribed in these Regulations.
A reasonable charge, computed in accordance with instructions issued by the Minister, shall be levied in respect of every loan of materiel except where such loans are made to the Boy Scout and Girl Guide Associations, Dominion and Provincial Rifle Associations or for community activities of a non-commercial, charitable nature or directly for the benefit of or in support of the Canadian Forces or national defence; in cases other than those mentioned in paragraph (a), when the Minister considers that it is in the public interest to reduce or waive the charge, in which event the Minister shall determine what rate, if any, shall be charged, but when the Minister reduces or waives a charge and the amount that the borrower is thereby absolved from paying is $1,000 or more, the Minister shall make a report to the Treasury Board.
Materiel of a consumable nature shall not be loaned but may be provided for purposes not inconsistent with these Regulations when the Minister considers that the national interest would thereby be served.
