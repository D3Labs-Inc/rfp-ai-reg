# Summary
Every employer shall arrange that work in a working area is carried out in a manner that does not endanger the safety or health of any person employed in the work or in connection therewith; adopt and carry out reasonable procedures and techniques designed or intended to prevent or reduce the risk of employment injury in the operation or carrying out of the work; and without limiting the generality of paragraphs (a) and (b), arrange that the safe working practices set out in these Regulations will be complied with.
No person shall tamper with, or make ineffective, any safeguard or safety device that is intended to maintain the safe condition of any working area, structure, machinery or equipment.
Where the owner of any working area, structure, machinery or equipment, any person employed in the operation, maintenance or repair of a ship, or in the loading or unloading of a ship, or an officer of an organization that represents the owner or a person described in paragraph (b), complains that a contravention of these Regulations has taken place, an inspector shall investigate the circumstances giving rise to the complaint.
