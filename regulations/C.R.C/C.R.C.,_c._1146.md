# Summary
Except as provided in subsection (12), the distance of a storage tank with a water capacity exceeding 100 Imperial gallons from any building on the installation site which is used exclusively by the company owning or operating the installation shall not be less than 10 feet.
An excess flow valve or other automatic device as prescribed in subsection (1) is not required for withdrawal connections of unrefrigerated tanks with a water capacity not exceeding 1,500 Imperial gallons, if the connection is protected by a controlling orifice not exceeding 5/16 inch diameter for vapour withdrawal and 1/8 inch diameter for liquid withdrawal, a manually operated shut-off valve, and a pressure-reducing regulator, all of which shall be assembled to the connection as prescribed in 2.2(d), Division II of the 1958 edition of National Fire Protection Association pamphlet No. 58.
