# Summary
A grant may, pursuant to this section, be made to a province or provincial agency in respect of any federal property in the province not exceeding the amount obtained by applying the effective rate of the real estate tax levied in the province or that part of the province where the federal property is situated in the appropriate tax year, to the accepted value of that federal property.
The Minister may, in determining the amount of any grant to a province or provincial agency under this section, deduct from the amount that might otherwise be payable an amount that, in the opinion of the Minister, represents the value of a service that is customarily furnished by the province to real property in the province and that Her Majesty does not accept in respect of federal property in the province, or the value of a service customarily furnished by provinces that is furnished to taxable property in the province by Her Majesty; and such other amount as the Minister considers appropriate having regard to the existence of any special circumstances arising out of any heavy concentration of federal property in the part of the province where the federal property is situated.
