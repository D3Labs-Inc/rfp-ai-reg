| 1 quarter  | The amount of the contribution payable by Canada to a province for an initial period is in relation to any province other than the Province of Alberta, that proportion of the amount, as determined by the Minister, obtained by multiplying the base year payment by the product of the cost increase factor and the population increase factor that the initial period is of a year; and in relation to the Province of Alberta, one-quarter of the base year payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 65.0 year  | For the purposes of paragraph 6(a), the cost increase factor is the quotient obtained by dividing the amount of the  per diem  cost of care for the period of computation comprising, at the election of the province, the initial period, or the year during which the initial period began, by the  per diem  cost of care for the base year; and the population increase factor is the quotient obtained by dividing an estimate of the number of persons in the total population of the province who were 65 years of age or over on whichever of the following dates last precedes or represents the first day of the second half of the initial period as determined by the Minister, namely, January 1st, April 1st, June 1st, July 1st or October 1st, by an estimate of the number of persons in the total population of the province who were 65 years of age or over on whichever of the following dates last precedes or represents the first day of the seventh month of the base year, namely, January 1st, April 1st, June 1st, July 1st or October 1st.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
