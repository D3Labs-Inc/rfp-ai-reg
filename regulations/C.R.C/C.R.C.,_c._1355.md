# Summary
For the purposes of subsection (1),  accumulated contributions  with respect to an employee means an amount equal to the contributions to the credit of that employee in either the Halifax Pilots’ Pension Fund or the Saint John Pilots’ Pension Fund, plus interest at the rate of three per cent per annum compounded annually and calculated from the middle of each fiscal year during the period of active service of that employee until February 1, 1973.
An employee in respect of whom an amount is paid into the Superannuation Account pursuant to section 3 may count the remainder, if any, of his service during which he contributed under the Halifax By-law or the Saint John By-law, as the case may be, that may not be counted as pensionable service under subsection 5(1) if he elects to pay for such service an amount calculated by the Minister as follows: where the employee so elects within six months of the time he is advised of the extent of the remainder of the period of service to his credit, an amount equal to the amount calculated in the manner described in subsection 5(1); and where the employee so elects after the period described in paragraph (a), an amount calculated as if clause 5(1)(b)(iii)(K) of the Act applied to him.
