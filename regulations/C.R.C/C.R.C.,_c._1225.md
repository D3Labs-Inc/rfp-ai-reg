# Summary
T-40 Order Prescribing Terms and Conditions for the Transmission of Telegraph and Cable Messages.
This Order may be cited as the  Telegraph and Cable Messages Terms and Conditions Order .
It is agreed between the sender of the message on the face of this form and this Company that said Company shall not be liable for damages arising from failure to transmit or deliver, or for any error in the transmission or delivery of any unrepeated telegram, whether happening from negligence of its servants or otherwise, or for delays from interruptions in the working of its lines, for errors in cypher or obscure messages, or for errors from illegible writing, beyond the amount received for sending the same.
To guard against errors, the Company will repeat back any telegram for an extra payment of one-half the regular rate; and, in that case, the Company shall be liable for damages suffered by the sender to an extent not exceeding $200, due to the negligence of the Company in the transmission or delivery of the telegram.
This Company shall not be liable in any case for damages, unless the same be claimed, in writing, within 60 days after receipt of the telegram for transmission.
