# Summary
An application to register a timber mark shall be in duplicate in Form 1, shall be prosecuted by correspondence and shall be addressed to “The Commissioner of Patents, Ottawa, Canada”.
Any document, other than a drawing relating to a timber mark, shall be clearly and legibly typewritten or printed on sheets of white paper of a quality satisfactory to the Commissioner, eight inches wide and 13 inches long, with a clear margin of one inch on the left-hand side.
Neither the title of the timber mark nor any descriptive matter shall appear on any part of a drawing sheet, but each sheet may bear in the lower right-hand corner the signature of the applicant or his agent.
An assignment presented for registration against a registered timber mark shall be the original document or a typed or printed copy thereof certified before a notary public to be a true copy.
If an assignment is accompanied by a duplicate or a notarially certified copy thereof, the duplicate or copy shall be returned by the Commissioner with a certificate of registration, but if an assignment is not so accompanied the Commissioner shall notify the person who presented it for registration of the number and date under which and of the timber mark against which it has been registered.
