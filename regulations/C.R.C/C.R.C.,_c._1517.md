# Summary
The application shall set forth the location of each intake well; the location of all oil and gas wells, including abandoned and drilling wells and dry holes and the names of permittees or lessees within two miles of each intake well; the formations from which wells are producing or have produced; the name, description and depth of each formation in which fluid is to be injected; the well completion program and the depth of the casing shoe or liner below which it is to be injected; the elevations of the top of the formation into which the fluid is to be injected in the intake well and the wells producing from the same formation within a two-mile radius of each intake well; a log of each intake well or such information as is available; a description of the fluid, stating the kind, where obtained and the estimated amounts to be injected daily; the name and address of the applicant or person to be in charge of the injection operation; and such other information as the Oil Conservation Engineer may require to ascertain whether the injection may be safely and legally made.
