# Summary
NATIONAL DEFENCE ACT Regulations Respecting Dental Treatment by Civilian Practitioners for Personnel of the Canadian Forces.
Notwithstanding section 2, where Canadian Forces Dental Services facilities are not available, civilian dental practitioners may undertake treatment, without prior authorization, in the following emergencies only: the relief of pain or acute infection, or the repair of broken dentures, but the reconstruction or alteration of any dental appliances is not permitted without prior authorization.
Civilian dental practitioners who treat personnel of the Canadian Forces under the authority of these Regulations shall be paid in accordance with the scale of fees authorized from time to time for that type of dental treatment when made in respect of persons under the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The civilian dental practitioner shall receive payment at the rates prescribed from time to time by the Treasury Board for civilian medical practitioners similarly employed by the Department of National Defence.
No payment shall be made unless the civilian dental practitioner submits a signed certificate certifying the specific days of the month on which services were rendered and for which payment is claimed, and the officer who authorized the work certifies that the certificate is correct.
