# Summary
The Agency shall, in the regulated area, and may, in the unregulated area, by order or regulation, establish a system for the licensing of persons who are engaged in the marketing of turkeys in interprovincial or export trade and such system may provide for the payment to the Agency of fees in respect of each licence issued pursuant to the system.
Within the regulated area and with respect to turkeys shipped from the unregulated area into the regulated area in interprovincial trade and not for export, the Agency shall exercise its powers in such a manner as to preclude any person from marketing turkeys in a province other than the province in which the turkeys are produced at a price that is less than the aggregate of the price charged at or about the same time for turkeys of an equivalent variety, class or grade in the province or other geographical area in which the turkeys are produced, and any reasonable transportation charges therefor to the place where such turkeys are marketed and that are incurred by the person marketing the turkeys.
