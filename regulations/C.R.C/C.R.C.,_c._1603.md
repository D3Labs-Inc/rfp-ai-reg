# Summary
An application for a licence to divert, use or store water for power purposes may be made to the Director and shall contain the following information: the name, address and occupation of the applicant; the name or a clear description of the river, lake or other watercourse from which the water is to be diverted or used; the place where the water is to be diverted from or in the said watercourse, referred if possible to an established monument of the existing system of land surveys, and the place where the water is to be returned or released; the maximum quantity of water, expressed in cubic feet per second, which it is estimated will be ultimately diverted or used under the licence applied for; the estimated average head in feet which will be available for the production of power according to the plan of development proposed; the estimated minimum amount of energy expressed in horsepower that will be developed on the turbine shaft within five years from the date of the application or within such other period as the applicant may state to be required for the completion of his initial development; the maximum amount of energy expressed in horsepower which it is estimated will ultimately be developed on the turbine shaft from the waters for which application is made; a brief statement with respect to the character and extent of all principal works the applicant proposes to construct; in respect of each dam involved, its approximate maximum length and height, its proposed type and the material to be used in its construction; where storage is involved, the location of each lake, basin or other place in which the applicant wishes to store water; for each storage reservoir, the approximate number of acres of land the applicant proposes to flood, the approximate area in acres of the surface of the reservoir when filled, the estimated vertical storage range in feet, and the total capacity of storage contemplated in acre-feet; and a reasonably accurate description and the acreage of the lands required for occupation or use in the construction, maintenance or operation of the proposed works, noting separately lands required for rights-of-way and lands that are to be flooded within public lands, within provincial Crown lands, and within privately owned lands.
