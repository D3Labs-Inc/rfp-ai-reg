# Summary
Where the insured does not pay, within the prescribed period of grace, a premium due under the policy and no proper application has been made for paid-up insurance or a cash surrender value, the policy shall be automatically continued in force for the full amount of insurance for the extension period, disregarding fractional parts of a month, that the cash surrender value at the date on which the premium fell due will provide if applied as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured.
Where the insured does not pay a premium by the end of the period of grace and the policy has not been changed to provide paid-up insurance, has not been surrendered for its cash surrender value or the automatic extension period has not expired, the insured may, with the consent of the Superintendent, and after such medical examination and other evidence of insurability as the Superintendent may deem necessary, restore the policy to a premium-paying basis at any time within five years from the due date of the first premium in default by payment of the arrears of premiums together with interest thereon at six per cent per annum compounded annually.
