# Summary
Before constructing any line that, when completed, will be along or across a railway, or near a line that is within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, the party proposing to do so shall apply to the party owning, operating or having control over the railway or line for its written consent to the construction and maintenance of the line; and if required, send to the party referred to in paragraph (c) detailed plans of the construction.
Notwithstanding section 5, in every case in which a railway or a line within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada is to be constructed along, across or near any existing line, the existing line shall be made to conform to such of the rules, requirements and specifications issued from time to time by the Canadian Standards Association and approved by the Commission as are applicable thereto or as are necessary to avoid interference with the service of the railway or line.
Where a railway or line is constructed across or near an existing line, such existing line shall be dismantled unless it has been constructed and is thereafter maintained in accordance with such of the rules, requirements and specifications issued from time to time by the Canadian Standards Association and approved by the Commission as are applicable thereto.
