# Summary
All goods originating outside Canada that are not in transit in bond on a through journey on a billing originating outside Canada or that do not otherwise come within the specific exceptions set forth in Group 9 of the  Export Control List  are subject to export control by virtue of Group 9 of that List and to the provisions of the  Export and Import Permits Act  and the regulations respecting export and import permits.
Where goods included in the  Export Control List  are to be exported from Canada to a country included in the  Area Control List  and are to move in transit through some other country, a transit authorization certificate respecting such movement may be issued by or on behalf of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
An application for a transit authorization certificate shall be made only by a person who may, under the  Export and Import Permits Act  and regulations, apply for an export permit for such goods.
An application for a transit authorization certificate shall be made on a form provided by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce and procurable from the Export and Import Permits Division of that Department.
