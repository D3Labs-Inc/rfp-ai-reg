# Summary
2, 1965 APPROPRIATION ACTS Regulations Respecting Interest on Returned Public Service Superannuation Contributions.
In these Regulations, "contribution" means an amount paid by or on behalf of a contributor to the Superannuation Account pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the  Public Service Superannuation Act  and that has been on deposit in the Superannuation Account for at least two years from the date of its receipt; and cannot be applied for the purpose for which it was originally paid into the Account because the election pursuant to which it was made is void.
Subject to subsection (2) and section 4, interest is payable on a contribution calculated in respect of each quarter in each fiscal year as of the last day of June, September, December and March at the rate of one per cent of the amount of the contribution on deposit.
Interest is payable, pursuant to subsection (1), from the first day of the first quarter commencing after the contribution was paid into the Superannuation Account until the last day of the quarter immediately preceding the day the contribution is paid out of that Account.
