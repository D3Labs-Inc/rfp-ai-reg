Every vessel, other than a pleasure craft, that is more than 6 m in length and that has an enclosed engine space shall be fitted with a fixed fire extinguishing system having a sufficient quantity of fire extinguishing agent for the protection of the space in accordance with the construction standards; or have provision for discharging a portable fire extinguisher that meets the requirements of section 416 or 514 directly into the engine space without the need to open the primary access to that space.
