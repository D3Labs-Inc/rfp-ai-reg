# Summary
The quantities of hatching eggs and live broilers (in egg equivalents) to be allocated to a hatchery in accordance with subsection (1) shall be adjusted downward in proportion to the total under-utilization (in egg equivalents) of the two quantities by the hatchery during the 12-month period preceding the calendar year during which the import allocation is to apply.
Subject to subsection (2), the method for allocating the import access quantity of egg products that may be imported into Canada in each calendar year is as follows: each applicant who was a holder of a historical quota that was allocated in 1994 on the basis of the quota allocated in 1974 and adjusted since, shall receive the same quantity of egg products as specified in the 1994 quota; and any remaining portion of the import access quantity of egg products shall be allocated to processors, wholesalers and distributors that are applicants in proportion to their respective market shares of egg products.
The quantity of egg products allocated to a holder, processor, wholesaler or distributor under paragraph (1)(a) or (b), as the case may be, shall be adjusted downward in proportion to any under-utilization by the holder, processor, wholesaler or distributor during the 12-month period preceding the calendar year in which the import allocation is to apply.
