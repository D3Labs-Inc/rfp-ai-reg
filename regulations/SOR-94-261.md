# Summary
For the purposes of sections 88 and 113 of the Act, the explicit chemical or biological name of a substance shall be masked by replacing a single distinctive element of the name with a non-descriptive term; replacing each of two or more distinctive elements of the name with a non-descriptive term; removing the locants; or removing the locants and replacing each of one or more other distinctive elements with a non-descriptive term.
Subject to subsection (2) and section 6, where the explicit chemical name of a substance cannot be described with a structural diagram, either of the following is a single distinctive element of that name: a constituent of the name that describes a complex mixture of a known class of chemicals including any substance that is recorded in the  Chemical Abstracts Chemical Substance Index  as an indefinite or general derivative of a specific chemical substance; or a constituent of the name that describes a complex mixture of an unknown class of chemicals including a substance that is recorded or is capable of being recorded in the  Chemical Abstracts General Subject Index  and can be named only by using descriptive or illustrative terms.
For the purposes of subsection (1), where a part of the explicit chemical name can be described with a structural diagram, the masking of that part shall be carried out in accordance with section 4.
