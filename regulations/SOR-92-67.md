# Summary
The airport reference point shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 151-331 distant 580.5 m from the threshold of runway 151.
The outer surface, shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centered on the airport reference point.

| 1989-07-25 | The airport reference point shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 151-331 distant 580.5 m from the threshold of runway 151.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1989-07-25 | The approach surfaces, shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 151-331, and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 151 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295.0 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 331 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295.0 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip. |
| 1989-07-25 | The outer surface, shown on Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739 dated July 25, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
