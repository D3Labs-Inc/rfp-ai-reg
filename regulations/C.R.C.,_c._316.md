# Summary
A pre-retirement benefit period is established in respect of an employee when, upon filing an application for pre-retirement benefit, he proves that he had been employed by a Canadian producer in at least 10 of the 15 years immediately preceding a lay-off and that he was paid by a producer for at least 1,000 hours in each of those 10 years; he was not less than 54 years of age but less than 65 years of age at the date of the lay-off; and he has been certified by the Commission as a person resident in Canada for whom there is no present prospect of employment with or without further training or relocation assistance, or who has accepted employment with earnings that are less than his average weekly insurable earnings.
The maximum pre-retirement benefit of an employee in respect of whom a pre-retirement benefit period has been established under these Regulations is a weekly sum of money equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of his average weekly insurable earnings, which amount shall be rounded to the nearest cent in accordance with subsection 12(2).
Notwithstanding subsection (1), section 60 of the  Unemployment Insurance Regulations  applies with such modifications as the circumstances require to pre-retirement benefits paid to employees not entitled thereto.
