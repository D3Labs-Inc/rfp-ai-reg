# Summary
The airport reference point shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 155T-335T distant 762 m from the threshold of runway 335T.
The outer surface, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The strip associated with runway 155T-335T, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 644 m in length.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centered on the airport reference point.

| 1989-06-16 | The approach surfaces, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 155T-335T, and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 155T consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 335T consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip. |
| 1989-06-16 | The outer surface, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
