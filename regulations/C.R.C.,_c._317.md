# Summary
The Board shall not certify persons or classes of persons as eligible to apply for pre-retirement benefit unless an application has been made pursuant to subsection (2), it has carried out such investigation as it considers necessary for the purpose and, in its opinion, the work force of a Canadian manufacturer has been or will be reduced through lay-offs by 10 per cent of the employees or 50 employees, whichever is the lesser, of the manufacturer, and for a period of at least four weeks; and the lay-offs referred to in paragraph (a) are directly attributable to import competition that resulted in an increase in the market share in Canada of footwear produced by manufacturing or processing activities outside Canada, and a decline in the production of footwear by a manufacturer.
Subject to subsections (1.1) and (2), a pre-retirement benefit may be paid by the Commission out of monies appropriated by Parliament for the purpose in an amount calculated in accordance with these Regulations to an employee who is a resident of Canada if the Commission is satisfied that an application for a benefit under the Act has been made and any benefit entitlement thereunder has been exhausted; a pre-retirement benefit period in respect of the employee has been established pursuant to section 5; the employee has not attained the age of 65 years; and the employee is not eligible to receive a retirement pension under the  Canada Pension Plan  or the  Quebec Pension Plan .
