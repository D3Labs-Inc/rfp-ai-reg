For the purposes of section 6, the effective date on which an amount is applied shall be where the amount is withheld pursuant to subsection 64.1(1) of the Act, the date that the person would have been entitled to receive the amount but for that subsection; and where the amount is repaid pursuant to subsection 64.1(2) of the Act, the date that the amount is received by the band.
