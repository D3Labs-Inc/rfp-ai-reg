# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
Each transitional surface, shown on Brandon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2307 dated January 2, 1987, is described as follows: the transitional surface associated with runway 08-26 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and the transitional surface associated with runway 14-32 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
