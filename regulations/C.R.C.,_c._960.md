The Minister or the council of a band, if authorized by the Minister pursuant to section 8, may issue to any person a permit authorizing that person to operate a garbage dump in a reserve; to use land in a reserve for the disposal or storage of waste; or to burn waste on any land in a reserve.
If the holder of a permit issued pursuant to section 5 operates a garbage dump in a reserve, uses land in a reserve for the disposal or storage of waste, or burns waste on any land in a reserve, other than in the manner specified in the permit, the Minister or the council of the band, whoever issued the permit, may cancel the permit and order the holder of the permit to close and clean up the garbage dump or to clean up the land in the reserve, as may be applicable, in a manner satisfactory to the Minister or the council.
