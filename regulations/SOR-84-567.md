# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
Each transitional surface, shown on Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-002-82-48, Sheets 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, dated August 24, 1983, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2006-02-05 | The approach surfaces, shown on Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-022-82-48, Sheets 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, dated August 24, 1983, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with runways designated 09-27 and 18-36 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 09 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 310 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 62.50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 18 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 375 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 60 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 27 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip;

| 2018-01-11 | The outer surface, shown on Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-002-82-48, Sheets 1 to 11 inclusive, dated August 24, 1983, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1983-08-24 | The outer surface, shown on Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-002-82-48, Sheets 1 to 11 inclusive, dated August 24, 1983, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 2006-02-05 | Each transitional surface, shown on Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-002-82-48, Sheets 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, dated August 24, 1983, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1983-08-24 | Each transitional surface, shown on Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-002-82-48, Sheets 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, dated August 24, 1983, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
