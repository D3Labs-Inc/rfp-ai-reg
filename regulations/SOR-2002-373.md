# Summary
On the recommendation of the Clerk, the Minister shall request that the Governor in Council make a determination of eligibility in respect of the member.
A member who abandons — or who is considered to have abandoned — their application for a determination of eligibility for a disability allowance, who has, in respect of a prior application, been determined by the Governor in Council to be ineligible for a disability allowance, or who has revoked an election to receive a disability allowance, is not prevented from subsequently submitting a new application to the Clerk.
A member in respect of whom the Governor in Council has made a determination of eligibility for a disability allowance may, within 90 days after the day on which the determination is made, make an election to receive the disability allowance by sending a notice to that effect to the Clerk, which notice shall be accompanied by details of the member’s resignation.
A member who makes an election to receive a disability allowance before the Governor in Council has made a determination of eligibility shall send a notice to that effect to the Clerk and shall submit, with their notice, the documents referred to in paragraphs 2(2)(a) and (b).
