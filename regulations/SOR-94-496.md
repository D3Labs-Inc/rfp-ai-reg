# Summary
CANADA TRANSPORTATION ACT Order Varying Decision No. 712-W-1993 of the National Transportation Agency.
P-14, provides that a Pilotage Authority shall with the approval of the Governor in Council make regulations prescribing tariffs to be paid to that Authority for pilotage and that all such tariffs be fair and reasonable consistent with providing a revenue, together with any revenue from other sources, sufficient to permit the Authority to operate as a self-sustaining financial basis; Whereas the Laurentian Pilotage Authority has since 1983 consistently fallen short of operating on a self-sustaining financial basis and incurred substantial deficits funded by the Department of Transport; And Whereas the Governor in Council considers that an increase in the Laurentian Pilotage Authority tariffs is seen as appropriate having regard to comparable tariffs in other pilotage regions; Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 64 of the  National Transportation Act, 1987 , hereby varies Decision No. 712-W-1993 of the National Transportation Agency by increasing the tariff of pilotage charges of the Laurentian Pilotage Authority by 8.9%.
