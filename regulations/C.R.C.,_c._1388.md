# Summary
Except for the amount of operational losses, as determined by the Minister, or other reductions effected with the prior concurrence of the Minister, the applicant shall maintain the amount of equity specified by the Minister pursuant to subsection (1) for a period of 24 months after the date the facility is brought into commercial production in the case of a facility in respect of which a development incentive is based on the approved capital costs only, or 36 months after the date the facility is brought into commercial production in the case of a facility in respect of which a development incentive is based in part on the number of jobs created in the operation.
The amount that the Minister shall, pursuant to section 10 of the Act, pay on account of a development incentive at the time he is satisfied that the facility has been brought into commercial production shall not exceed an amount equal to 80 per cent of the authorized development incentive as calculated at that time without taking into account the approved capital costs of any eligible assets not at that time in use in the operation; or jobs forecast for purposes of the authorization that, in the opinion of the Minister at that time, will not be created in the operation.
