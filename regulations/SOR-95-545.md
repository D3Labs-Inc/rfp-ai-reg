The outer surface, shown on Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3041, dated February 7, l995, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point extending to the outer boundary described in Part VI, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3041, dated February 7, l995, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3041, dated February 7, 1995, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
