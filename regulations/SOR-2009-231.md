| 1996-02-20 | The outer surface, shown on Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Plan No. 06-006 94-128, Sheets 1 to 4, 6 to 20 and 22 to 24, dated February 20, 1996, is an imaginary surface established at a constant elevation that is 45.000 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference points, except that, where that surface is less than 9.000 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9.000 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1996-02-20 | The transitional surfaces associated with runways 07L-25R, 07R-25L, 07C-25C and 14-32, shown on Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Plan No. 06-006 94-128, Sheets 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 and 19, dated February 20, 1996, are imaginary inclined surfaces that extend upward and outward from the lateral limits of the abutting strip surface and the abutting take-off/approach surface rising at a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 7.000 m measured horizontally and perpendicularly to the centreline of each strip surface and take-off/approach surface, to an intersection with the outer surface or with the transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2018-04-22 | The transitional surfaces for runway 04-22, shown on Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Plan No. 06-006 94-128, Sheets 7, 8 and 12, dated February 20, 1996, are imaginary inclined surfaces that extend upward and outward from the lateral limits of the abutting strip surface and the abutting take-off/approach surface rising at a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 7.000 m measured horizontally and perpendicularly to the centreline of each strip surface and take-off/approach surface, to an intersection with the outer surface or with the transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1996-02-20 | The transitional surfaces for runway 04-22, shown on Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Plan No. 06-006 94-128, Sheets 7, 8 and 12, dated February 20, 1996, are imaginary inclined surfaces that extend upward and outward from the lateral limits of the abutting strip surface and the abutting take-off/approach surface rising at a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 7.000 m measured horizontally and perpendicularly to the centreline of each strip surface and take-off/approach surface, to an intersection with the outer surface or with the transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
