# Summary
Where it appears to the Bank that a bond and unmatured coupons attached to it, if any, cancelled by a bank incorporated under the  Bank Act  or the  Quebec Savings Banks Act  have been destroyed, lost or stolen while in the custody of the bank or in the course of transit from a branch of the bank to its main office or to any agency of the Bank, if the bank certifies that the bond and each coupon attached thereto was effectively cancelled for purposes and in accordance with arrangements expressly approved by the Bank and gives to the Bank an undertaking to indemnify in accordance with section 37 duly executed on its behalf at its head office and three months have elapsed after the day on which the Bank received notice of the destruction, loss or theft, the Bank may, in its discretion, issue a new bond and appropriate coupons in place of them.
An undertaking to indemnify given to the Bank under these Regulations shall be executed by the owner or payee of the bond, coupon, cheque or certificate that has been damaged, defaced, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, or by any other person acceptable to the Bank and shall undertake to indemnify the Bank and the Government of Canada for any loss resulting from the issue of any new bond or cheque or the making of any payment in respect thereof and shall be in a form satisfactory to the Bank.
