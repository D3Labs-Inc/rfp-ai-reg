# Summary
FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT Order Respecting the Remission of Customs Duty Paid on Imported Articles and Materials Used or Consumed in the Manufacture of Railway Rolling Stock Purchased by Canadian Companies for Use in International Service.
Remission granted under section 3 shall be paid to a manufacturer of railway rolling stock if a claim for remission is made to the Minister subsequent to the date the railway rolling stock entered international service; the customs duty on the articles and materials in respect of which the claim referred to in paragraph (a) is made was paid within the four year period immediately preceding the date on which the claim for remission was filed; and the manufacturer provides to the Minister such information in such form and manner as may be required by the Minister for the administration of this Order.
Where imported articles or materials referred to in section 3 enter into a process of manufacture that results in the production of merchantable scrap or waste, the remission payable under this Order in respect of the articles or materials shall be reduced by a sum to be arrived at by applying to the Canadian sales value of the merchantable scrap or waste the prevailing rates of customs duty on merchantable scrap or waste of the same kind when imported as such.
