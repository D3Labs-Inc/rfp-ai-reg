# Summary
Subject to subsection (2), the Minister shall refuse to register an applicant or renew an applicant’s registration if the applicant is not eligible under section 58; the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that any information or document included in the application is false or misleading; additional information required under section 61 has not been provided or is insufficient to process the application; the registration would permit an activity that would not be in compliance with an international obligation of Canada; information received from a competent authority, the United Nations or a peace officer raises a reasonable belief that the applicant has been or will be involved in the diversion of a controlled substance or precursor to an illicit market or use; the applicant is not, or within the previous 10 years has not been, in compliance with a provision of the Act or a regulation made or continued under the Act, or a term or condition of a licence, registration certificate or permit issued to it under any regulation made or continued under the Act; the senior person in charge mentioned in the application has been convicted, as an adult, within the previous 10 years of a designated drug offence, a designated criminal offence, or an offence committed outside of Canada that, if committed in Canada, would have constituted an offence referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii); or the registration would likely create a risk to public health, safety or security, including the risk of a Class B precursor being diverted to an illicit market or use.

| 10.0 year  | Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 84(1), the Minister shall revoke a registration and the corresponding registration certificate if the registered dealer is no longer an eligible person under section 58; the registration was made on the basis of false or misleading information or false or falsified documents; the registered dealer has contravened the Act or any regulation under the Act, a condition of the registration or a provision of a registration certificate, a licence or an import or export permit issued under any regulation under the Act; it is discovered that the senior person in charge has been convicted, as an adult, within the previous 10 years of a designated drug offence, a designated criminal offence, or an offence committed outside of Canada that, if committed in Canada, would have constituted an offence referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii); information received from a competent authority, the United Nations or a peace officer raises a reasonable belief that the registered dealer has been or will be involved in the diversion of a controlled substance or precursor to an illicit market or use; the continuation of the registration would likely create a risk to public health, safety or security, including the risk of a Class B precursor being diverted to an illicit market or use; or the registration would permit, having regard to an activity mentioned in a notice of change of information, an activity that would not be in compliance with an international obligation of Canada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 7 day      | The Minister shall refuse to issue a Class B export permit if the applicant is not a registered dealer or is a registered dealer whose registration will expire prior to the proposed date of export; a circumstance described in any of paragraphs 63(1)(b) to (f) and (h), with any modifications that the circumstances require, exists with respect to the permit application; the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that the export shipment to which the permit would apply would contravene the laws of the country of final destination or any country of transit or transhipment; within seven days after the Minister sends pre-export notification of the proposed export to the competent authority in the country of final destination, the Minister has received written notice from the authority that it has refused to authorize the proposed import or that it objects to the import; or the proposed shipment would not be in conformity with an import authorization or letter of non-objection issued by the competent authority in the country of final destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
