# Summary
Where a child of a non-taxable employee is not accommodated at a school mentioned in section 2, the Minister may arrange for the child to be accommodated at a school in the municipality in which the employee resides, or if, in the opinion of the Minister, the school facilities in that municipality are inadequate, at a school in a municipality having adequate facilities for the purpose, but a report shall be submitted to the Treasury Board whenever attendance at a school outside the municipality in which the employee resides is authorized stating the reasons for the arrangement and the additional costs resulting, if any.
Where a child of a non-taxable employee, pursuant to an arrangement under section 3, attends a school that is not less than five miles and not more than thirty miles from the place of residence, and to attend the school uses a public transportation service approved for the purpose by the Minister, other than the service mentioned in subsection (2) or an urban public transportation service, the Minister may pay to the employee the amount by which the cost to the employee of the service that is rendered to the child exceeds three dollars a month.
