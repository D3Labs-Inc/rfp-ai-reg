# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 18-36 distant 762.0 m from the end of runway 18.
The outer surface, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centered on the airport reference point.

| 1989-01-17 | The airport reference point shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 18-36 distant 762.0 m from the end of runway 18.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1989-01-17 | The approach surfaces, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 18-36, and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 18 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75.0 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 36 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75.0 m above the elevation at the end of the strip. |
| 1989-01-17 | The outer surface, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
