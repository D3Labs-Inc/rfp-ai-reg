# Summary
No owner or lessee of any lands in respect of which these Regulations apply shall permit an object of natural growth to exceed in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 3 that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at the location of the object.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada Moose Jaw Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3054, dated August 1997, being a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
Those areas lying within the outer limits of lands affected by these Regulations, as those limits are more particularly described in Part 7, and which are shown on Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada Moose Jaw Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3054, dated August 1997 as: 1:40 approach surfaces; 1:60 approach surfaces; and transitional surfaces on Sheet Numbers 12, 20, 24, 25, 26, 32, 33, and 40.

| 1997-08-01 | The approach surfaces, shown on Department of Public Works and Government Services Moose Jaw Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3054, dated August 1997, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with runways 10L-28R, 10R-28L and 03-21, and that are more particularly described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 10L consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 60 m measured horizontally rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence the approach surface shall slope upward at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15,000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2,400 m from the projected centre line; the imaginary horizontal line being 291.1 m measured vertically above the assigned elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 28R consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 60 m measured horizontally rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence the approach surface shall slope upward at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured

| 1997-08-01 | The outer surface, shown on Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada Moose Jaw Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3054, dated August 1997, is an imaginary surface that consists of a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport zoning reference point, except that, where the common plane is less than 9 m above the ground at any point, the outer surface is an imaginary plane located at 9 m above the ground.
