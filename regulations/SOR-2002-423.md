# Summary
1. Section 23 of the Act is adapted as follows: For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions referred to in subsection 22(1), a compliance officer may conduct a compliance audit of an employer and, for that purpose, may at any reasonable time, enter any place in which the officer believes on reasonable grounds there is any thing relevant to the enforcement of any of those provisions; and require any person to produce for examination or copying any record, book of account or other document that the officer believes on reasonable grounds contains information that is relevant to the enforcement of any of those provisions.
If national security information was reviewed by a compliance officer during a compliance audit of the Service, the compliance officer shall provide the Director with a copy of any report, direction, request for undertaking or other document prepared by the officer as a result of the audit before the document is disclosed to any person who is not Commission staff or who is not a member of a Tribunal.
If the Director makes a declaration with respect to information contained in a document examined under subsection (5), the portion of the public service or public sector that was provided with the document shall ensure that the national security information is removed forthwith from the document.
