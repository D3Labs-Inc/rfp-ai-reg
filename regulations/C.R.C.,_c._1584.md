# Summary
Where, prior to the death of a veteran, he had money on deposit in a bank, post office or other financial institution, a person was indebted to the veteran or held money in trust for him, a person had in his custody or control moneys of the veteran, or the veteran was entitled to an undistributed interest in an estate, the Estates Officer may direct that the amount to which the veteran was so entitled be paid to the Receiver General for credit to the deceased's account.
Where a bank, financial institution or any person has in its or his custody or control a bond belonging to a veteran, the Estates Officer may receive the bond and either sell or present it for redemption, and cause the proceeds to be paid to the Receiver General for credit to the deceased's account or, upon the written request of the person legally entitled upon distribution of the estate, cause the bond to be registered in such person's name or be transferred into bearer form and be delivered to him.
