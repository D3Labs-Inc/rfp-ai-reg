| 12.0 month | Resolution of directors If the directors of a mutual property and casualty insurance company wish to pursue its conversion, they must pass a resolution recommending conversion and setting out a date before the eligibility date by which any mutual policy that will be issued after the eligibility date and before the day on which the special resolution referred to in section  5  is passed must have been applied for so that its holder qualifies as an eligible mutual policyholder; and any group of policyholders who hold non-mutual policies — other than those who have held their policies for the 12-month period ending on the eligibility date — who are to qualify as eligible non-mutual policyholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
