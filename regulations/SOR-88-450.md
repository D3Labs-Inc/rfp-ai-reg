strips associated with runways designated 05-23 and 11-29 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 05 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 23 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 11 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 075 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 137.5 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 43 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 29

| 2018-05-23 | The approach surfaces, shown on Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87, Sheets 2 to 8 inclusive and 10 to 13 inclusive, dated April 2, 1986 are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with runways designated 05-23 and 11-29 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 05 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 23 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 11 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 075 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 137.5 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 43 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 29 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 100 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 140 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 44 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-11-29 | The approach surfaces, shown on Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87, Sheets 2 to 8 inclusive and 10 to 13 inclusive, dated April 2, 1986 are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with runways designated 05-23 and 11-29 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 05 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 23 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 11 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 075 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 137.5 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 43 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 29 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 100 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 140 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 44 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-02-08 | Each transitional surface, shown on Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87, Sheets 2 to 8 inclusive and 11 and 12, dated April 2, 1986, is described as follows: the transitional surface associated with runway 05-23, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; the transitional surface associated with runway 11-29, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1986-04-02 | Each transitional surface, shown on Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87, Sheets 2 to 8 inclusive and 11 and 12, dated April 2, 1986, is described as follows: the transitional surface associated with runway 05-23, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; the transitional surface associated with runway 11-29, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2018-05-23 | Each transitional surface, shown on Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87, Sheets 2 to 8 inclusive and 11 and 12, dated April 2, 1986, is described as follows: the transitional surface associated with runway 05-23, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; the transitional surface associated with runway 11-29, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2018-11-29 | Each transitional surface, shown on Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87, Sheets 2 to 8 inclusive and 11 and 12, dated April 2, 1986, is described as follows: the transitional surface associated with runway 05-23, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; the transitional surface associated with runway 11-29, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
