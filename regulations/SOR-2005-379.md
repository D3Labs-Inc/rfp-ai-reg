exploration for the purpose of quartz mining, on a quartz grant On other than an Indian reserve, a quartz exploration program if the activities do not take place under, or within 40 m of, an oil or natural gas pipeline, and do not involve any of the following activities: construction of a structure with a foundation, or the construction of a structure without a foundation intended for use for a period of more than 12 consecutive months; construction of an underground structure in which 500 t or more of rock is moved to the surface; use of a campsite by more than 10 persons at the same time; use of a campsite for more than 250 person-days; storage of petroleum fuel in a container with a capacity of more than 2000 L; storage of petroleum fuel if the total amount stored on all of the quartz

hand or with hand-held tools; construction of a corridor of more than 5 m in width; construction of corridors if the combined length of the corridors on all of the quartz grants in the program is more than 0.5 km; establishing a road, re-establishing a road that has not been usable for more than five years by vehicles that it was originally designed to serve, modifying a road to provide usability for vehicles that are of different types than those it was originally designed to serve or any other upgrading or modifying of a road, other than for maintenance, repair or erosion control; on other than category A settlement land and category B settlement land, establishing a trail that is not a temporary trail; on category A settlement land or category B settlement land, establishing a trail, including a temporary trail, or using a temporary trail that was established for another program; on other than category A settlement land and category B settlement land, establishing a temporary trail or using a temporary trail that was established for another program, if the trail is 7 m or more in width or more than 1 m wider than the width of the equipment required for the program, or the trail is used for purposes other than moving sampling equipment between test sites; on other than category A settlement land and category B settlement land, establishing a temporary trail, or using a temporary trail that was established for another program, if the combined length of those temporary trails on all of the quartz grants in the program is more than 3 km; trenching, for the purpose of obtaining geological information, of a total volume of more than 1200 m 3  for each combination of three adjoining quartz grants in the program provided no quartz grant in the program forms part of more than one combination of grants, or more than 400 m 3  per quartz grant that is not part of a combination of three adjoining grants referred to in subparagraph (i); establishing a clearing, other than a corridor, that involves the removal of the vegetative mat within 30 m of a water body; establishing a clearing, other than a corridor, that results in more than eight clearings that are not

program: two clearings for helicopter landing pads, two clearings for camps, or one clearing for a helicopter landing pad and one for a camp; use of a vehicle off a road or trail, other than in winter, that applies more than 35 kPa of pressure to the ground; use of a vehicle, on a road or trail, with a gross vehicle weight that exceeds the design parameters of the road or trail, or if the design parameters of the road or trail are unknown, that exceeds 40 t on a road or 20 t on a trail; use of vehicles, off a road or trail in winter, that have gross vehicle weights of more than 40 t and apply more than 35 kPa of pressure to the ground, over a distance of more than 15 km in total on all of the quartz grants in the program; or use of a total of more than 1000 kg of explosives in

reserve, a placer mining operation if the activities do not take place under, or within 40 m of, an oil or natural gas pipeline, and do not involve any of the following activities: construction of a structure with a foundation, or the construction of a structure without a foundation intended for use for a period of more than 12 consecutive months; use of a campsite by more than 10 persons at the same time; use of a campsite for more than 250 person-days in a 12-month period; storage of petroleum fuel in a container with a capacity of more than 2000 L; storage of petroleum fuel if the total

exploration for the purpose of quartz mining, on a quartz grant On other than an Indian reserve, a quartz exploration program if the activities do not take place under, or within 40 m of, an oil or natural gas pipeline, and do not involve any of the following activities: construction of a structure with a foundation, or the construction of a structure without a foundation intended for use for a period of more than 12 consecutive months; construction of an underground structure in which 500 t or more of rock is moved to the surface; use of a campsite by more than 10 persons at the same time; use of a campsite for more than 250 person-days; storage of petroleum fuel in a container with a capacity of more than 2000 L; storage of petroleum fuel if the total amount stored on all of the quartz grants in the program is more than 5000 L at any one time; cutting a line, for the purpose of carrying out a geophysical, geological or engineering survey, of more than 1.5 m in width or other than by hand or with hand-held tools; construction of a corridor of more than 5 m in width; construction of corridors if the combined length of the corridors on all of the quartz grants in the program is more than 0.5 km; establishing a road, re-establishing a road that has not been usable for more than five years by vehicles that it was originally designed to serve, modifying a road to provide usability for vehicles that are of different types than those it was originally designed to serve or any other upgrading or modifying of a road, other than for maintenance, repair or erosion control; on other than category A settlement land and category B settlement land, establishing a trail that is not a temporary trail; on category A settlement land or category B settlement land, establishing a trail, including a temporary trail, or using a temporary trail that was established for another program; on other than category A settlement land and category B settlement land, establishing a temporary trail or using a temporary trail that was established for another program, if the trail is 7 m or more in width or more than 1 m wider than the width of the equipment required for the program, or the trail is used for purposes other than moving sampling equipment between test sites; on other than category A settlement land and category B settlement land, establishing a temporary trail, or using a temporary trail that was established for another program, if the combined length of those temporary trails on all of the quartz grants in the program is more than 3 km; trenching, for the purpose of obtaining geological information, of a total volume of more than 1200 m 3  for each combination of three adjoining quartz grants in the program provided no quartz grant in the program forms part of more than one combination of grants, or more than 400 m 3  per quartz grant that is not part of a combination of three adjoining grants referred to in subparagraph (i); establishing a clearing, other than a corridor, that involves the removal of the vegetative mat within 30 m of a water body; establishing a clearing, other than a corridor, that results in more than eight clearings that are not corridors, including existing clearings, on any one of the quartz grants in the program; establishing a clearing, other than a corridor and other than for a helicopter landing pad or camp, having a surface area of more than 200 m 2 ; establishing a clearing for a helicopter landing pad or a camp having a surface area of more than 500 m 2 ; establishing a clearing having a surface area of more than 200 m 2  for a helicopter landing pad or a camp that results in more than the following numbers of clearings of that size — including existing clearings — on any one of the quartz grants in the program: two clearings for helicopter landing pads, two clearings for camps, or one clearing for a helicopter landing pad and one for a camp; use of a vehicle off a road or trail, other than in winter, that applies more than 35 kPa of pressure to the ground; use of a vehicle, on a road or trail, with a gross vehicle weight that exceeds the design parameters of the road or trail, or if the
