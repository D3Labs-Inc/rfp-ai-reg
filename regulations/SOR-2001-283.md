http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-283/FullText.html


# Summary
The notice shall be sent not later than the latest of, as the case may be, one year after the day on which these Regulations come into force; one year after the day on which the judge and the judge’s spouse are married; or two years after the day on which the judge began cohabiting in a conjugal relationship with the judge’s common-law partner.
If the Annuity Administrator becomes aware that erroneous or misleading information was sent to a judge regarding the period within which the judge could make an election, the amount of the monthly instalments of the judge’s annuity described in subparagraph 9(b)(i), or the amount of the monthly instalments of the optional survivor annuity, the Annuity Administrator shall notify the judge of the corrected information by registered mail.
The amount representing the reduction that was made in the judge’s annuity shall be repaid to the judge, together with interest as set out in subsection 44.2(3.1) of the Act. Proof of age of the judge’s spouse or common-law partner is established by a birth certificate issued by a civil authority.
