# Summary
Subject to these Regulations, the annual rate at which the pension of a recipient is payable shall be increased by the lesser of the following rates, namely, an annual rate determined by multiplying the lesser of the annual rate at which the pension is payable, or the annual rate specified for such recipient in Column I of Schedule B, by the percentage figure in Column II, III, IV, V, VI or VII (whichever is appropriate) of Schedule A that is directly opposite the description of the period in Column I of Schedule A that includes the latest period of service of the employee to or in respect of whom the pension was granted or is payable that was used to calculate the pension, or an annual rate that when added to the annual rate at which the pension is payable totals the annual rate specified for such recipient in Column II of Schedule B, but in no case shall the annual rate at which the pension of a recipient is payable be increased if that rate exceeds the annual rate specified for such recipient in Column II of Schedule B.
