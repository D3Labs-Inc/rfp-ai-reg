# Summary
Where it appears to a member or an authorized representative of the Commodity Board or a police constable that a vehicle is transporting vegetable in violation of any regulation or order of the Commodity Board, he may order the person in control of the vehicle to stop the vehicle.
No person other than a member or an authorized representative of the Commodity Board shall, without written authority from the Commodity Board, move, destroy, sell or offer for sale any vegetable in respect of which a detention tag has been attached or a notice of detention has been given pursuant to subsection (1).
Where, at the conclusion of the hearing referred to in subsection (1), the Commodity Board determines that the vegetable seized was not marketed in violation of these Regulations or, if so marketed was marketed inadvertently, the Commodity Board may return the vegetable to its owner or the person from whom it was seized or market it through the Agency on behalf of the owner.
Where, at the conclusion of the hearing referred to in subsection (1), the Commodity Board determines that the vegetable seized was being marketed in violation of these Regulations, the Commodity Board may dispose of the vegetable in the manner described in section 8.
