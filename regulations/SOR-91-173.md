the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 343.8 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 44.8 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2018-01-09 | The outer surface, shown on Chatham Airport Zoning Plan No. 36-011 86-08, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated January 28, 1987, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an

| 1987-01-28 | The outer surface, shown on Chatham Airport Zoning Plan No. 36-011 86-08, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated January 28, 1987, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1987-01-28 | Each transitional surface, shown on Chatham Airport Zoning Plan No. 36-011 86-08, Sheets 4, 5 and 6, dated January 28, 1987, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
