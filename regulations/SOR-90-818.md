# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Moncton Airport Zoning Plan Numbers S-2021-3, S-2021-4, S-2021-9 and S-2021-10, dated March 12, 1988, is determined by measuring 655 m northerly along the centre line of runway 02-20 from the southerly end of runway 02 and thence measuring 183 m easterly at right angles from the said centre line.
The outer surface, shown on Moncton Airport Zoning Plan Numbers S-2021-0, S-2021-2 to S-2021-5 inclusive and S-2021-8 to S-2021-11 inclusive, dated March 12, 1988, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The boundary of the outer limits of the lands to which these Regulations apply, shown on Moncton Airport Zoning Plan Numbers S-2021-0, S-2021-2, S-2021-6, S-2021-8, S-2021-9 and S-2021-11, dated March 12, 1988, is a circular area with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
