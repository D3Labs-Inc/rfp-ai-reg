| 7 year     | Exemption A responsible person for an old unit may, on application made to the Minister, be exempted from the application of subsection  3 (1) in respect of the old unit for a period of 24 consecutive months that begins on January 1 of the calendar year that follows the calendar year in which the application is made if the following conditions are satisfied: an existing unit and the old unit have a common owner who has a ownership interest of 50% or more in each of those two units; the production capacity of the existing unit, during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the application is made, was equal to or greater than the production capacity of the old unit during that preceding calendar year; the existing unit and the old unit are located in the same province; the quantity of CO 2  emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in the existing unit are determined in an accordance with a system or method referred to in subsection  20 (1); the quantity of CO 2  emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in the existing unit that are captured, transported and stored is determined using a direct measure of the flow of, and the concentration of CO 2  in, the emissions from that combustion of fuel; the emissions referred to in paragraph (e) are captured in accordance with the laws of Canada or a province that regulate that capture and are transported and stored in accordance with the laws of Canada or a province, or of the United States or one of its states, that regulate that transportation or storage, as the case may be; the emissions referred to in paragraph (e) are captured, transported and stored for a period of seven consecutive calendar years; the emissions referred to in paragraph (e) comprise at least 30% of the quantity of CO 2  emissions produced from the combustion of fossil fuels in the existing unit for each calendar year during that seven-year period; and the existing unit does not reach the end of its useful life during that seven-year period. |

| 2025-01-01 | Revocation — implementation report or reasonable grounds The Minister may revoke the temporary exemption if the responsible person has not provided an implementation report in accordance with section  11 ; there are reasonable grounds for the Minister to believe that the carbon capture and storage system will not operate so as to capture, transport and store CO 2  emissions as described in paragraph  10 (e) by the date referred to in that paragraph; or there are reasonable grounds for the Minister to believe that the responsible person will not emit CO 2  from the combustion of fossil fuels in the unit in accordance with subsection  3 (1) by January 1, 2025.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2018-01-01 | Exemption A responsible person for an old unit may, on application made to the Minister, be exempted from the application of subsection  3 (1) in respect of the old unit for a period of 24 consecutive months that begins on January 1 of the calendar year that follows the calendar year in which the application is made if the following conditions are satisfied: an existing unit and the old unit have a common owner who has a ownership interest of 50% or more in each of those two units; the production capacity of the existing unit, during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the application is made, was equal to or greater than the production capacity of the old unit during that preceding calendar year; the existing unit and the old unit are located in the same province; the quantity of CO 2  emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in the existing unit are determined in an accordance with a system or method referred to in subsection  20 (1); the quantity of CO 2  emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in the existing unit that are captured, transported and stored is determined using a direct measure of the flow of, and the concentration of CO 2  in, the emissions from that combustion of fuel; the emissions referred to in paragraph (e) are captured in accordance with the laws of Canada or a province that regulate that capture and are transported and stored in accordance with the laws of Canada or a province, or of the United States or one of its states, that regulate that transportation or storage, as the case may be; the emissions referred to in paragraph (e) are captured, transported and stored for a period of seven consecutive calendar years; the emissions referred to in paragraph (e) comprise at least 30% of the quantity of CO 2  emissions produced from the combustion of fossil fuels in the existing unit for each calendar year during that seven-year period; and the existing unit does not reach the end of its useful life during that seven-year period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
