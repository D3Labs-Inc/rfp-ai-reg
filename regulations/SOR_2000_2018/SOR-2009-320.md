# Summary
Application This Order establishes the method for allocating the quantity of softwood lumber products that may be exported during a month from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 2010 for the purposes of paragraph 6.3(3)(a) of the Act. Relinquishing an export allocation For the purposes of this Order, a primary producer or remanufacturer relinquishes their export allocation for 2010 by so informing the Minister in writing by December 11, 2009.
Primary producers without an export history If none of a primary producer’s products were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period and if the primary producer produced Quebec softwood lumber products during the period beginning on January 1, 2006 and ending on December 31, 2008 and it applies for an export allocation, the primary producer may only receive the allocation calculated in accordance with the formula set out in subsection 8(1) (which is based on its historic production volume).
Allocation The allocation of the Saskatchewan quantity to a primary producer or remanufacturer who applies for an export allocation is calculated in accordance with the formula SQ × (ES/TSQ) where SQ is the Saskatchewan quantity; ES is the volume of the primary producer’s or remanufacturer’s products that were exported from Saskatchewan to the United States under export permits during the reference period; and TSQ is the total of the Saskatchewan quantities for the reference period.
