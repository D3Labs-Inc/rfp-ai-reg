# Summary
Notice of seizure If a property taxation law provides for the seizure and assignment of taxable property for unpaid taxes, interest or penalties, and taxes, interest or penalties remain unpaid more than nine months after a tax arrears certificate was issued, the tax administrator may deliver to the debtor a notice describing the proceedings — referred to in sections 10 to 16 — that may be taken in respect of the taxable property if the amounts owing are not paid.
Timing of sale Subject to subsections 15(1) and (3), not less than six months after delivery to the debtor of the notice referred to in section 9, a right to an assignment of the taxable property may be sold by public tender or auction.
Timing of seizure Subject to subsection (2), if the taxes, interest and penalties remain unpaid more than seven days after delivery of the notice of seizure and sale of the personal property, the tax administrator may request a sheriff, bailiff or by-law enforcement officer to seize any personal property described in the notice that is in the possession of the debtor and is located on the reserve.
