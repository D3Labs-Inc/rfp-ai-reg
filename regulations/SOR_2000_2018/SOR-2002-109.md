# Summary
Nothing in these Regulations shall be interpreted so as to negate the requirement to obtain permission under section 93 of the  Indian Act  before removing timber from a reserve.
These Regulations apply in respect of the cutting of timber on first nation lands.
The  Indian Timber Regulations  do not apply in respect of the cutting of timber on first nation lands.
Subject to subsections (2) and (3), no person shall cut timber on first nation lands without a licence.
A person acting on behalf of the council of a band may, without a licence, cut timber on behalf of that council of the band on any reserve lands of the band that have not been allotted by the council of the band or designated by the band and that are not already subject to a licence, if the timber and any product made from the timber is intended for use on first nation lands of the band.
The Minister or a peace officer may seize any timber cut on first nation lands that was not cut under the authority of a licence or in accordance with subsection 4(2) or (3).
