# Summary
2009-1036 Whereas, pursuant to subsection 332(1) a  of the  Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 b , the Minister of the Environment published in the  Canada Gazette , Part I, on April 26, 2008, a copy of the proposed  Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Automotive Refinishing Products Regulations , substantially in the form set out in the annexed Regulations, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the proposed Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection; S.C. 2004, c.
Sell or offer for sale A person must not sell or offer for sale any automotive refinishing product set out in column 1 of the schedule if its VOC concentration exceeds the limit set out in column 2 for that product unless the product is required to be diluted before use to a VOC concentration equal to or less than that limit set out in column 2 and the manufacturer, importer or seller, as the case may be, specifies the instructions for dilution on the product’s label or accompanying documentation, in both official languages; or the product was manufactured or imported under a permit issued under section 5 and the sale or offer to sell occurs no later than one year after the day on which the permit expires.
