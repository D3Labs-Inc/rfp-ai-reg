| 1 year     | Interpretation For the purposes of this Part, an individual is considered to be a child if the individual is a child or stepchild of — or an individual adopted either legally or in fact by — a participant or pensioner who, at the time of the participant’s or pensioner’s death, was dependent on that person for support; and an individual is considered to be a survivor if the individual is a person who was married to a participant or pensioner at the time of the death of the participant or pensioner, or a person who establishes that he or she was cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature with a participant or pensioner for at least one year immediately before the death of the participant or pensioner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6 hour     | Wage measure The wage measure is for a year prior to 2007, the corresponding rate of pay shown in the schedule; and for a year after 2006, the greater of the standard basic rate of pay for a period of duty or training of six hours or more — before any retroactive adjustment — that was prescribed or established under the  National Defence Act  to be paid, on October 1 of the preceding year, to a member at the rank of Corporal (A), and the wage measure of the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5 year     | Updated pensionable earnings The updated pensionable earnings, for a calendar year, are the lesser of an amount determined by the formula A × B where A is the participant’s pensionable earnings for that year, and B is the result of the following formula, rounded to the nearest fourth decimal point: C/D where C is the average of the wage measures for five years consisting of the year the member most recently ceased to be a participant and the most recent years during which the member was a participant and, if necessary, the years preceding all of those years, and D is the wage measure for that calendar year, and the product calculated under paragraph  6 (2)(a) for the year the member most recently ceased to be a participant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
