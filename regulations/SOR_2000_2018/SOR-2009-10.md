# Summary
Primary producers without an export history If none of a primary producer’s products were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period and if the primary producer produced Quebec softwood lumber products during the period beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending on December 31, 2007 and it applies for an export allocation, the primary producer may only receive the allocation calculated in accordance with the formula set out in subsection 8(1) (which is based on its historic production volume).
Allocation The allocation of the Saskatchewan quantity to a primary producer or remanufacturer who applies for an export allocation is calculated in accordance with the formula SQ × (ES/TSQ) where SQ is the Saskatchewan quantity; ES is the volume of the primary producer’s or remanufacturer’s products that were exported from Saskatchewan to the United States under export permits during the reference period; and TSQ is the total quantity of current softwood lumber products that could have been exported from Saskatchewan to the United States during the reference period.
