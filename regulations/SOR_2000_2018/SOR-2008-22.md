# Summary
The Minister shall take the following factors into account in determining whether it is necessary to establish a review panel: whether the information in the notice of objection raises scientifically founded doubt as to the validity of the evaluations, on which the decision was based, of the health and environmental risks and the value of the pest control product; and whether the advice of expert scientists would assist in addressing the subject matter of the objection.
If the Minister determines that it is necessary to establish a review panel of one or more persons, each person selected by the Minister shall possess scientific knowledge that allows them to evaluate the subject matter of the objection; not have been employed in any department, in any division or branch of the federal public administration, in any corporation or in any parent Crown corporation as set out, respectively, in Schedules I, I.1, II and III to the  Financial Administration Act , within one year before the day on which they are appointed to the review panel; have provided the Minister with a written statement indicating that they are free from any actual or potential conflict of interest that relates to the decision under review; and have undertaken in writing to disclose to the Minister in writing, without delay, any actual or potential conflict of interest that may arise and affect their duties as a member of the review panel.
