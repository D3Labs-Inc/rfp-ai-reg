# Summary
The following method is to be used for testing the structural integrity of a crib under dynamic conditions: assemble the crib according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test; if a mattress is supplied with the crib, remove it; secure the crib to a horizontal surface in a manner that will not interfere with the conduct of the test and place the mattress support in its lowest position; place on the mattress support a test mattress that is made of polyurethane foam that is 76 mm thick and that has a density of 30 kg/m 3  ± 6 kg/m 3  and a 25% indentation force deflection (IFD) of 144 N ± 30 N, has dimensions that are no more than 25 mm narrower than the interior dimensions of the crib, and is covered with a tight-fitting 8- to 12-gauge vinyl material; using the 20-kg load illustrated in the figure to this section, cause the load to fall freely onto the geometric centre of the surface of the test mattress from a height of 150 mm above its upper surface, measured at the outset of the test; remove the load after two seconds; repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (e) and (f) 149 times at the rate of one impact every four seconds for a total of 150 impacts; record any damage to the crib, any disengagement or permanent deformation of its latching or locking mechanisms and any loosening of its fasteners; without readjusting the mattress support, repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (e) to (g) near a mattress support mechanism, causing the load to fall at a point that is 150 mm from the innermost surface of each of the nearest crib sides, measured from the geometric centre of the load, and repeat the step set out in paragraph (h); and repeat the steps set out in paragraph (i) for all the other mattress support mechanisms; and if the crib has any access sides, repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (e) to (h) at the midpoint along the edge of the mattress support beside each access side, causing the load to fall at a point that is 150 mm from the side, measured from the geometric centre of the load.

| 10.0 second | The following method is to be used for testing completely bounded openings that are located above the mattress support of a crib that has rigid sides: assemble the crib according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test; if the mattress support is adjustable, adjust it to its lowest position; place the metallic loading wedge illustrated in the figure to this section in the opening between two adjacent slats, midway along the greatest dimension of the opening; apply a pull force of 90 N to the eyebolt — either open or closed — of the loading wedge in a direction perpendicular to a plane passing through the points of contact of the wedge with the two slats and maintain the force for 10 seconds; while applying that force, attempt to pass, without forcing, a solid rectangular block with the dimensions 60 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm through the opening, anywhere above or below the loading wedge; repeat the step set out in paragraph (e) with the block in all other possible orientations; repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) to (f) for all the other openings between adjacent slats; and attempt to pass, without forcing, a solid rectangular block with the dimensions 60 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm through all the other completely bounded openings that are located above the mattress support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
