# Summary
( autorité de certification ) digital signature certificate , in respect of a person, means an electronic document that identifies the certification authority that issued it and is digitally signed by that certification authority; identifies, or can be used to identify, the person; and contains the person's public key.
( biclé ) private key  means a string of data that is used in asymmetric cryptography to encrypt data contained in an electronic document; and is unique to the person who is identified in, or can be identified through, a digital signature certificate and corresponds only to the public key in that certificate.
( clé privée ) public key  means a string of data contained in a digital signature certificate that is used in asymmetric cryptography to decrypt data contained in an electronic document that was encrypted through the application of the private key in the key pair; and corresponds only to the private key in the key pair.
When the technology or process set out in section 2 is used in respect of data contained in an electronic document, that data is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been signed by the person who is identified in, or can be identified through, the digital signature certificate.

| 2018-12-01 | ( clé privée ) public key  means a string of data contained in a digital signature certificate that is used in asymmetric cryptography to decrypt data contained in an electronic document that was encrypted through the application of the private key in the key pair; and corresponds only to the private key in the key pair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2018-12-01 | For the purposes of the definition  secure electronic signature  in subsection 31(1) of the Act, a secure electronic signature in respect of data contained in an electronic document is a digital signature that results from completion of the following consecutive operations: application of the hash function to the data to generate a message digest; application of a private key to encrypt the message digest; incorporation in, attachment to, or association with the electronic document of the encrypted message digest; transmission of the electronic document and encrypted message digest together with either a digital signature certificate, or a means of access to a digital signature certificate; and after receipt of the electronic document, the encrypted message digest and the digital signature certificate or the means of access to the digital signature certificate, application of the public key contained in the digital signature certificate to decrypt the encrypted message digest and produce the message digest referred to in paragraph (a), application of the hash function to the data contained in the electronic document to generate a new message digest, verification that, on comparison, the message digests referred to in paragraph (a) and subparagraph (ii) are identical, and verification that the digital signature certificate is valid in accordance with section 3. |
