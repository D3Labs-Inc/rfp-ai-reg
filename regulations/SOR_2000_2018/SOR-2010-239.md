# Summary
For the purpose of paragraph 995(1)(b) of the Act, an electronic document need not be provided to the designated information system if the electronic document is posted on or made available through a generally accessible electronic source, such as a website; and the addressee is provided in writing with a notice, in paper or electronic form, of the availability and location of the electronic document.
If the addressee’s consent is provided orally, the originator or the person acting for the originator shall, without delay, provide the addressee in writing, in paper or electronic form, with the information referred to in subsection (2) and confirm the information referred to in subsection (4).
An electronic document is considered to have been provided to an addressee when it leaves an information system within the control of the originator or the person acting for the originator; or when it is posted on or made available through the secure website of the originator.
An electronic document is considered to have been received when it enters the information system designated by the addressee; when it is posted on or made available through the secure website of the originator; or when the notice referred to in paragraph 4(1)(b) is received by the addressee.
