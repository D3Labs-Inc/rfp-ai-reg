| 16.0 year    | Amount determined by Minister For the purposes of section 7 of the Act, the special payment amount for a province as determined by the Minister after consultation with the Chief Statistician of Canada is the amount for the fiscal year that is obtained by multiplying the total costs for the fiscal year for provinces where apprentices registered with those provinces are able to enter into apprentice loan agreements for the fiscal year, by the ratio of the estimated number of persons in the province in question who are at least 16 years of age but less than 65, to the estimated number of persons of those ages in provinces where apprentices registered with those provinces are able to enter into apprentice loan agreements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
