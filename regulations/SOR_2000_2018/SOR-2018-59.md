# Summary
Amount of compensation For the purposes of determining the amount of compensation to which a prescribed person is entitled, the Corporation must estimate the liquidation value and resolution value of the person’s shares or liabilities that are referred to in subsection  2 (1).
Determination of compensation Subject to subsection (7), the amount of compensation to which a prescribed person is entitled with respect to each share or liability is determined by the formula A − B − C where A is the estimated liquidation value; B is the estimated resolution value; and C is if the share or liability is converted into common shares in accordance with its terms, an amount equal to an estimate of losses attributable to that conversion, or in any other case, zero.
Payment of compensation The Corporation must pay a prescribed person the compensation that they are entitled to receive within if a notice referred to in subsection  11 (1) is provided to the person, 90 days after the date of that notice; or in any other case, 135 days after the day on which a summary of the notice referred to in section  4  is published in the  Canada Gazette .
