# Summary
The steps must include the notification of the fire service that is responsible for the area where the fire is located if the fire cannot be extinguished or controlled without fire service assistance; and the notification, if applicable, of the railway company that operates or maintains the line work.
Prevention measures A railway company that is conducting high-risk work in an area must take the fire prevention measures that are set out in the railway company’s fire hazard reduction plan for the fire danger level for that area.
Fire danger level not available If a fire danger level is not available for the area, the railway company must ensure that the employees and contractors who are conducting the high-risk work are equipped with the fire suppression equipment that is set out in the railway company’s fire hazard reduction plan for at least a moderate fire danger level.
The steps must include the notification of the fire service that is responsible for the area where the fire is located if the fire cannot be extinguished or controlled without fire service assistance; and the notification of the railway company that operates or maintains the line work.
