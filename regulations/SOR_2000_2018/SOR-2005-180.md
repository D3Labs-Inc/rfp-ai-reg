A provincial authority may not issue a safety fitness certificate to an extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking unless the provincial authority has obtained the information and documents set out in section 4 of Part C of NSC Standard #14.
An extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking that applies for a safety fitness certificate must provide to the provincial authority, subject to subsection (3), written proof that it holds the minimum liability insurance coverage and endorsement referred to in section 7.
An extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking that has provided proof of an undertaking to purchase the liability insurance must provide to the provincial authority written proof of coverage before it will be issued a safety fitness certificate.
A provincial authority may not issue a safety fitness certificate to an extra-provincial truck undertaking unless it has written proof that the undertaking holds the minimum liability insurance coverage and endorsement referred to in subsections (2) to (4).
