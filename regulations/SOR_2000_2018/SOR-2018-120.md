| 2 month    | Notice In respect of an application other than a divisional application, the Minister must by notice inform an applicant whose application does not contain all the documents, information and statements referred to in paragraph (2)(a) of which documents, information and statements are outstanding and require that the applicant submit them no later than two months after the date of the notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3 month    | Objections Subject to subsection (3), if the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that the design is not registrable, the Minister must send to the applicant a report setting out the objections to registration and inviting the applicant to reply to the objections no later than three months after the date of the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 6 month    | Reinstatement An application that is deemed to be abandoned is reinstated if the applicant, within six months after the day on which the application is deemed to be abandoned, submits a request for reinstatement to the Minister; replies in good faith to the report; and pays the fee set out in item 9 of the schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30.0 month | Delayed registration In respect of an application other than a Hague application, on the request of the applicant and on payment of the fee set out in item 11 of the schedule, the Minister, if it is technically feasible, must not register a design until the day that is 30 months after the filing date of the application or, if a request for priority is made in respect of the application, after the earliest filing date of a previously regularly filed application on which the request for priority is based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3 month    | Limitations on amendment An application must not be amended to change the identity of the applicant, except, in respect of an application other than a Hague application, to record a transfer of the application under section 13 of the Act or to substitute an applicant under subsection 4(2) of the Act; to add a representation of a design; to change a representation of a design if the amendment would result in the application being for a design that differs substantially from the design that was the subject of the application on its filing date or, in the case of a divisional application, on the day on which the Minister received the divisional application; to add or amend a statement under section  17  or  18  if the addition or amendment would result in the application being for a design that differs substantially from the design that was the subject of the application on its filing date or, in the case of a divisional application, on the day on which the Minister received the divisional application; or to add an indication that it is a divisional application, if more than three months have passed since the day on which the Minister received the application. |

| 3 month    | Copy of previously filed application If an applicant requests priority in respect of a pending application on the basis of one or more previously regularly filed applications — other than an application previously regularly filed in or for Canada — the Minister may by notice request that the applicant of the pending application, no later than three months after the date of the notice, at the option of the applicant, either submit to the Minister a copy of the previously regularly filed application certified as correct by the office in which it was filed and a certificate from that office showing its filing date, or make a copy of the previously regularly filed application available to the Minister from a digital library that is specified by the Minister or Commissioner as being accepted for that purpose and inform the Minister that it is so available; and if the previously regularly filed application is in a language other than English or French, submit to the Minister an English or French translation of the whole or a specified part of the previously regularly filed application.                                                                                |
| 3 month    | Translation not accurate If the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that a translation submitted under subsection (1) is not accurate, the Minister may by notice request that the applicant, in the case of the pending application, submit to the Minister, no later than three months after the date of the notice, a statement by the translator to the effect that, to the best of their knowledge, the translation is accurate; or a new translation together with a statement by its translator to the effect that, to the best of their knowledge, the new translation is accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6 month    | Extension The time period for complying with a request under subsection (1) or (2) is extended by six months if, within that time period, the applicant submits to the Minister a request for an extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
