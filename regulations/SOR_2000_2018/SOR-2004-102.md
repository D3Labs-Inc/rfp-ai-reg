# Summary
Where a person who has appealed under the  Excise Act, 2001  has not elected in the notice of appeal that sections 18.3001 and 18.3003 to 18.302 ( Informal Procedure ) of the Act shall apply, that person may, within 90 days from the date on which the reply is served or within such additional time as the Court may, on motion for special reasons, allow, make such an election.
Subsection 195(1) of the  Excise Act, 2001  provides: Any person who has been assessed and who objects to the assessment may, within 90 days after the date of the notice of the assessment, file with the Minister a notice of objection in the prescribed form and manner setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts.” The application pursuant to subsection (1) is deemed to have been filed on the date of its receipt by the Registry, even if the application is not accompanied by the documents listed in subsection (3), provided that those documents are filed within 30 days after that date or within any reasonable time that the Court establishes.
