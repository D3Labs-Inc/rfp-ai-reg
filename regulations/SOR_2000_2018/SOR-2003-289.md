# Summary
Subject to subsection (2), a person who installs, services, leak tests or charges a refrigeration system, an air-conditioning system or a fire-extinguishing system, or who does any other work on any of those systems that may result in the release of a halocarbon, shall recover, into a container designed and manufactured to be refilled and to contain that specific type of halocarbon, any halocarbon that would otherwise be released during those procedures.
Effective 90 days after the day on which these Regulations come into force, no person shall charge a refrigeration system that is installed in, that is attached to, or that normally operates in conjunction with a means of transportation, other than a refrigeration system for use on a military ship or a chiller, with a halocarbon listed in any of items 1 to 9 of Schedule 1.
The owner of a refrigeration system, an air-conditioning system or a fire-extinguishing system shall maintain a written record, or a record in an electronic format compatible with that used by the Minister, in which the information set out in column 3 of item 5 or 6, as the case may be, of Schedule 2 is entered whenever the system is installed, serviced, leak-tested or charged or if any other work is done on it that may result in the release of a halocarbon.
