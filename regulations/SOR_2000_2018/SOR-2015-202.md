| 10.0 year  | Calculation of administrative burden For the purpose of section 5 of the Act, the cost of the administrative burden imposed by a regulation is the sum of the cost of each activity that is expected to be completed during the first 10 years after the regulation is registered and is calculated in accordance with the following formula: A × 0.142378 ÷ 1.07 B - 2012 where A is the activity cost that is the sum of the cost for each activity for each period, and is calculated in accordance with the following formula: C × D × E ÷ 1.07 F ÷ G where C is the estimated hourly cost of labour, adjusted to 2012 price levels using the Consumer Price Index set out by Statistics Canada in CANSIM Table 326-0021, as amended from time to time, that is required in a period so that a business is able to complete the activity within that period; D is the estimated number of hours required in a period so that the business is able to complete the activity within that period; E is the estimated number of businesses that are required in a period to complete the activity within that period; F is the specific period, out of the total number of periods determined in accordance with subsection (2), for which the calculation is being made; and G is the number of times per year that the activity is required to be completed; and B is the year the regulation is registered. |
