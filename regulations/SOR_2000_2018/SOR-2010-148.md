A participant may be appointed to the public service under a student employment program if the participant meets the qualifications for the work to be performed and the appointment is free from personal favouritism or political influence.
A participant who is a Canadian citizen, within the meaning of the  Citizenship Act , must be appointed to the public service under a student employment program ahead of other persons who are not Canadian citizens and who have not previously been appointed to the public service under a student employment program if the participant meets the qualifications for the work to be performed.
A participant appointed to the public service under a student employment program who is selected as a result of an advertised internal appointment process may not be appointed under that process before they have successfully completed their post-secondary education program or vocational training program.
