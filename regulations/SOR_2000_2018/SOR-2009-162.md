# URL
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2009-162/FullText.html


# Summary
If a point source is being used to control the release of hexavalent chromium compounds from a tank located at a facility at which chromium electroplating, chromium anodizing or reverse etching is carried out on the day on which this section comes into force, subsection (1) applies 30 months after that day.
If surface tension limiting is being used to control the release of hexavalent chromium compounds from a tank located at a facility at which chromium electroplating, chromium anodizing or reverse etching is carried out on the day on which this section comes into force, subsection (1) applies three months after that day.
The owner or operator of chromium electroplating, chromium anodizing or reverse etching equipment must keep all records, reports, inspection and maintenance plans, floor plans depicting the location of tanks and, if applicable, the location of control devices and fans, test results and other information required by these Regulations at the facility where that equipment is located or, on notification to the Minister, at any other place in Canada where the documents can be inspected for a period of at least five years beginning on the date of their creation.

| 2005-01-01 | The following conditions apply in respect of every release test performed under this section: the test must be performed under representative operating conditions without using dilution air; the sampling must be performed in accordance with generally accepted standards of good scientific practice at the time of the sampling by a sampler trained to perform release sampling for chromium using a documented and validated method, and consist of three two-hour sampling runs, each of which results in a minimum sample volume of 1.7 dscm; the analysis of the sample from each of the three sampling runs must be performed in accordance with generally accepted standards of good scientific practice at the time of the analysis by a laboratory located in Canada that is accredited by a Canadian accrediting body under the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 entitled  General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories , as amended from time to time, and whose accreditation includes the analysis of chromium within its scope of testing; the analysis of the sample from each of the three sampling runs must be performed with an analytical method whose precision and accuracy are based on a minimum of seven replicate samples and that has a method detection limit of at least 8 µg/L of chromium, a precision of 5% relative standard deviation at 10 times the method detection limit, and an accuracy of 100% ± 5% based on analyte recovery at least 10 times the method detection limit; and the average of three sampling runs must not exceed the chromium release limit prescribed in paragraph  4 (1)(b). |
| 2018-01-15 | The smoke test must be conducted using a smoke test device that generates 15 to 30 m 3  of smoke for every 2 m 2  of tank surface and using a process that allows the smoke test device to burn completely inside the tank while the tank cover is closed and to fill the space under the cover with smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
