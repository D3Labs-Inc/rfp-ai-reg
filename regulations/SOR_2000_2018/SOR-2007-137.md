Before a person removes human reproductive material from a donor’s body after the donor’s death for the purpose of creating an embryo, the person shall have a document signed by the donor stating that, before consenting to the removal, the donor was informed in writing that the human reproductive material will be removed in accordance with the donor’s consent to create an embryo for one or more of the following purposes, namely, the reproductive use of the person who is, at the time of the donor’s death, the donor’s spouse or common-law partner, improving assisted reproduction procedures, or providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures; if the donor wishes to withdraw their consent, the withdrawal must be in writing; the withdrawal is effective only if the person who intends to remove the human reproductive material is notified in writing of the withdrawal before the removal of the material; and human reproductive material removed from the donor cannot be used for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a) unless the person who intends to make use of the material has the donor’s written consent under Part 1 respecting the use of the material.
