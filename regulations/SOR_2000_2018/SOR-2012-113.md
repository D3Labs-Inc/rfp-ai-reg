# Summary
An interest holder, as defined in section 49 of the Act, shall, over the life of a project beginning on the day on which the development plan is submitted under subsection 143(2) of the Act, provide the following information to the Federal Minister no later than June 30 of each year for the preceding year: the project gross revenues; any information provided under the Offshore Petroleum Royalty Act for the purpose of the calculation of the royalties payable under that Act in respect of the project; and at the request of the Federal Minister, any other information necessary to determine the profit in relation to a project or to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided under this section.
The provincial cash flow for a year is equal to the amount determined by the following formula: A × (B 1  – C 1 ) – D 1 where A is the Provincial Crown share; B 1 is the gross revenues of the project for the year determined under section 8; C 1 is the sum, for the year, of the project operating and capital costs, as specified in the development plan approved in respect of the project under section 143 of the Act converted to current dollars using the forecasted Canadian gross domestic product (GDP) deflator in that year, and the project royalties that would be payable under the Offshore Petroleum Royalty Act; and D 1 is the sum, for the year, of the acquisition payment determined under subsection 10(1) and the income tax payable.
