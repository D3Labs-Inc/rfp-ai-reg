# Summary
Establishment of Judicial Conduct Review Panel The Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson of the Judicial Conduct Committee, established by the Council in order to consider complaints or allegations made in respect of a judge of a superior court may, if they determine that a complaint or allegation on its face might be serious enough to warrant the removal of the judge, establish a Judicial Conduct Review Panel to decide whether an Inquiry Committee should be constituted in accordance with subsection 63(3) of the Act. Designation of members The senior member designates the members of the Judicial Conduct Review Panel.
Serious matter The Judicial Conduct Review Panel may decide that an Inquiry Committee is to be constituted only if it determines that the matter might be serious enough to warrant the removal of the judge.
The Council’s Executive Director must send a copy of the Judicial Conduct Review Panel’s decision, reasons and statement of issues to the judge and their Chief Justice; the Minister; and the Inquiry Committee, once it is constituted.
Despite these By-laws, the  Canadian Judicial Council Inquiries and Investigations By-laws , as they read immediately before the day on which these By-laws come into force, continue to apply in respect of any inquiries or investigations being conducted by a Review Panel or an Inquiry Committee or the Council acting under section 11 or 12, that were commenced under those By-laws.
