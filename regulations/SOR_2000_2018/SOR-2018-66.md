# Summary
Records — compressors and vents A record must be made that indicates for each compressor referred to in section  14 its serial number; its make and model; its rated brake power; the date on which it was installed at the facility, if it was installed on or after January 1, 2020, or a demonstration, with supporting documents, that it was installed at the facility before January 1, 2020; if applicable, the type of hydrocarbon gas conservation equipment or hydrocarbon gas destruction equipment to which the emissions of hydrocarbon gas from the its seals or rod packing and distance pieces, as the case may be, are captured and routed, namely a vapour recovery unit, a vent gas capture system, a flare, an enclosed combustor, or another type, and if so, a description of the type; for each centrifugal compressor for which emissions from its seals are routed to vents that release those emissions to the atmosphere, whether the seals are dry or wet; for each reciprocating compressor from which emissions from its rod packings and distance pieces are routed to vents that release those emissions to the atmosphere, the number of those rod packings; and for each compressor for which the period within which a measurement by a flow meter must be made has been extended under subsection  16 (6), the number of hours during which it was pressurized during the three calendar years referred to in that subsection.

| 48.0 hour   | Steady state A measurement taken under any of subsections (2) to (4) must be taken while the well is operating in a steady state, that is, it must be taken only if no adjustment that could result in a change to the oil or gas production rates has been made to the production parameters for at least 48 hours before the measurement is taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 90.0 day    | Regulatory or alternative LDAR programs An operator for a facility must — in order to limit fugitive emissions containing hydrocarbon gas from equipment components at the facility — establish and carry out at the facility a regulatory leak detection and repair program that satisfies the requirements of sections  30  to  33 ; or an alternative leak detection and repair program referred to in subsection  35 (1) that results in at most the same quantity of those fugitive emissions as would result from a regulatory program referred to in paragraph (a), as demonstrated in a record, with supporting documents, made by the operator before the program is established and, at least once per year and at least 90 days after a previous demonstration, while the program is being carried out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
