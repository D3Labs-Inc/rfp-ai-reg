# Summary
If the application includes a request to designate a person to be a system participant, the proposed system participant’s name, identifying information and contact information; the address of each facility to be used by the proposed system participant for carrying on controlled activities, including the location and station mask of each ground station and telemetry, tracking and command station; and a copy of an agreement or proposed agreement between the applicant and the proposed system participant that specifies the territory from which the proposed system participant will communicate raw data and provide remote sensing products or will give commands to the remote sensing satellite, the proposed system participant’s data protection plan that contains the information and documents referred to in sections 22 to 29 of this Schedule as modified to relate to the proposed system participant’s operations, and, if the applicant intends to permit the proposed system participant to formulate or give a command to a remote sensing satellite of the system, its command protection plan that contains the information and documents referred to in sections 14 to 21 of this Schedule as modified to relate to the proposed system participant’s operations, how the proposed system participant will make raw data and remote sensing products available to the governments of countries whose territories have been sensed by the system, how the proposed system participant will make raw data available to the applicant before the data is disposed of, how the proposed system participant will assist the applicant to provide service pursuant to an order under section 15 of the Act, the proposed system participant’s obligation to maintain records, the address where the records will be maintained and the proposed system participant’s obligation to allow the applicant access to them, the proposed system participant’s obligation to make periodic or other reports to the applicant, the proposed system participant’s obligation to allow the applicant or an inspector access to their facilities in order to monitor compliance with the proposed system participant’s data protection plan and the proposed system participant’s command protection plan, if any, and the obligation of the proposed system participant to allow the applicant or an inspector access to their facilities in order to monitor compliance on the part of the applicant with the applicant’s command protection plan and data protection plan and the applicant’s requirements under the Act, these Regulations and the conditions of the licence.
