| 4 hour     | The following method is to be used to test whether a carbonated beverage glass container shatters in such a way as to cause perforation: as illustrated in the figure of the test apparatus, provide a flat and horizontal support surface that is 10 cm in diameter, on a supporting structure of four corner posts 16 mm in diameter, four straight rods 16 mm in diameter, forming a square frame with outside dimensions of 80 cm for each side centred on the vertical centreline through the support surface and parallel to, and with the upper edges of the rods 80 cm above, the support surface, a drill probe of adjustable height, with a horizontal axial centreline in a vertical plane that passes equidistant between two opposite sides of the square frame, a sharp “MM Glazemaster Glass Drill, 4.5 mm, Type A”, affixed to and axially centred on the drill probe, a drill probe drive mechanism capable of rotating the probe 0.2 revolutions per second while advancing the drill 0.254 mm per second towards the vertical centreline through the support surface, and two support points for the container of adjustable height, located and oriented as shown in the figure; cover the top and the four vertical sides of the supporting structure using clear polyethylene plastic sheets of a thickness of 0.035 ± 0.005 mm, and using supplementary means of attachment as required, so that a single sheet of plastic, 80 cm wide, is suspended across the side facing the drill probe, two sheets of plastic, each 33 cm wide, are suspended on the side where the drill probe is located with a gap of 14 cm between the two sheets, symmetrical with the drill probe centreline, a single sheet of plastic, 80 cm wide, is suspended across the top and the other two sides, the lower edges of the plastic sheets extend below the plane of the support surface, and the lower edges of the plastic sheets are subjected to a uniformly distributed downward force of 39 N/m of width by the use of weight rods; remove from the container any packaging and label that does not remain on it after its sale and during its use; ensure that the unopened container is equilibrated to a test temperature by storing it in a water bath at 22°C for four hours and is equilibrated as to pressure at that temperature by ultrasonic agitation immediately before the test; ensure that the plastic sheets are free of any perforation; adjust the drill probe and the support points to the mid-height of the container; place the container upright and unopened on the support surface and against the support points; adjust the probe drive mechanism to a linear velocity of 0.254 mm per second and a rotational velocity of 0.2 revolutions per second, and advance the drill probe until it pierces the container; and if the container shatters, note whether any piece or part of the container has perforated the plastic sheets above the horizontal plane of the support surface. |
| 4 hour     | The following method is to be used to test the distance of projection of a carbonated beverage glass container that has shattered: as illustrated in the figure of the test apparatus, provide a block of concrete, 50 cm long, 40 cm wide and 20 cm high, having a smooth, flat and horizontal impact surface, positioned on a flat and horizontal concrete base, a rigid cylinder, with an inside diameter of 2 m and a height of 20 cm, placed vertically on the concrete base so that it is concentric with the concrete block, and the upper edge of the cylinder is in the plane of the impact surface, and a drop mechanism, consisting of two horizontal support bars of 6 mm diameter with their centrelines 4 cm apart positioned symmetrically over the longitudinal centreline of the impact surface and with their upper edges 75 cm above the impact surface, capable of permitting a free fall of the container from its horizontal support position by a snap action withdrawal of the two support bars in symmetrical paths downward and away from the container while maintaining the bar centrelines horizontal; remove from the container any packaging and label that does not remain on it after its sale and during its use; ensure that the unopened container is equilibrated to a test temperature by storing it in a water bath at 25°C for four hours and is equilibrated as to pressure at that temperature by ultrasonic agitation immediately before the test; clear and clean the area inside and outside the cylinder; place the container horizontal and unopened, centred between and on the support bars, with the vertical plane through the mid-height of the container passing through the transverse centreline of the impact surface; activate the drop mechanism allowing the container to fall freely on the impact surface; if the container shatters, collect, clean, dry and weigh all pieces and parts of the container, including the top and label, that have travelled beyond the outside diameter of the cylinder, and collect, clean, dry and weigh all pieces and parts of the container, including the top and label, that have remained within the inside diameter of the cylinder; and calculate the dry weight of the container by adding the weights obtained in subparagraphs (g)(i) and (ii).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
