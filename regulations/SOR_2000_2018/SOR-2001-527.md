# Summary
If a lessor and a lessee agree to improve the original equipment that is the subject of a capital lease and to amend the capital lease, the Minister’s liability under these Regulations continues if the capital lease is amended accordingly and if the capital lease as amended has a term that does not extend beyond the maximum period specified in section 5; the annual imputed rate of interest used in the calculation of the scheduled payments is the same as the annual imputed rate of interest used in the original capital lease; the lessor notifies the Minister in writing of the improvements made to the equipment within three months of the day on which the amendment to the capital lease was made, and provides the Minister with the following information, namely, the detailed cost of the improvements, a detailed calculation of the revised payments, the additional cost of the equipment that has been financed, and the new outstanding balance of the capital lease; and the lessor sends to the Minister, with the notice referred to in paragraph (c), an additional registration fee that is calculated on the basis of the additional cost of the equipment that has been financed.
