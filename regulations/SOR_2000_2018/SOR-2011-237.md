# Summary
Exception — west coast If, in respect of a voyage to a port, offshore terminal or anchorage area on the west coast of Canada, the requirements of paragraph (4)(b) cannot be met because doing so is infeasible or would compromise the stability or safety of the vessel or the safety of persons on board the vessel, an exchange may be conducted in an area at least 45 nautical miles west of Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands and at least 45 nautical miles west of a line extending from Cape Scott to Cape St. James where the water depth is at least 500 m, with the exception of waters within 50 nautical miles of the Bowie Seamount (53°18′ north latitude and 135°40′ west longitude).
Ballast Water Reporting Form If a vessel is bound for a port, offshore terminal or anchorage area in Canada, its master — or, in the case of a pleasure craft, its operator — must, in the manner set out in section 5.2 of TP 13617, submit to the Minister a completed Ballast Water Reporting Form as soon as feasible after a management process, or a measure required under subsection 13(4), is implemented.
