# Summary
The following method is to be used for testing the safety device of a carriage or stroller that folds: erect the carriage or stroller in the manufacturer’s recommended use position with the latching device released; apply a force of 200 N at the location and in the direction normally associated with the folding action of the carriage or stroller; note the amount of folding movement, if any; and repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) with a dummy that meets the requirements set out in Schedule 9, placed in the centre of each seating unit.
