# Summary
Information — general Every expansion gate and expandable enclosure must have indelibly printed on it or permanently affixed to it, in English or in French, the following information, clearly and prominently displayed in numerals and block letters at least 2.5 mm in height that contrast sharply with the background by their colour, projection or indentation: the name and principal place of business in Canada of the manufacturer, importer or distributor; its model name or model number; and the year and month of its manufacture, or a code or other identification that identifies that year and month.
Warning — general Every expansion gate and expandable enclosure must have indelibly printed on it or permanently affixed to it, either the following warning in English and in French, clearly and prominently displayed in numerals and letters that contrast sharply with the background by their colour, projection or indentation, or visual images, clearly and prominently displayed, that concisely and readily convey the same meaning as the text of the warning: WARNING Install according to manufacturer’s instructions.
