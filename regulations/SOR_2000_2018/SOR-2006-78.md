| 2018-01-27 | The take-off/approach surfaces, shown on Waterloo Regional Airport Zoning Plan No. 30-035 02-020, Sheets 1 to 27, dated April 30, 2003, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip surfaces associated with runways 07-25 and 14-32, and are described as follows: the take-off/approach surface abutting the 07 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 25 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 14 end of the strip surface associated with runway 14-32, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 3 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 600.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 60.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 32 end of the strip surface associated with runway 14-32, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at

| 2003-04-30 | The take-off/approach surfaces, shown on Waterloo Regional Airport Zoning Plan No. 30-035 02-020, Sheets 1 to 27, dated April 30, 2003, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip surfaces associated with runways 07-25 and 14-32, and are described as follows: the take-off/approach surface abutting the 07 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 25 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the

| 2018-07-25 | The take-off/approach surfaces, shown on Waterloo Regional Airport Zoning Plan No. 30-035 02-020, Sheets 1 to 27, dated April 30, 2003, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip surfaces associated with runways 07-25 and 14-32, and are described as follows: the take-off/approach surface abutting the 07 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 25 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 14 end of the strip surface associated with runway 14-32, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 3 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 600.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 60.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 32 end of the strip surface associated with runway 14-32, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 3 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 600.000 m on either

| 2018-07-25 | The take-off/approach surfaces, shown on Waterloo Regional Airport Zoning Plan No. 30-035 02-020, Sheets 1 to 27, dated April 30, 2003, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip surfaces associated with runways 07-25 and 14-32, and are described as follows: the take-off/approach surface abutting the 07 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 25 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 14 end of the strip surface associated with runway 14-32, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 3 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 600.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 60.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 32 end of the strip surface associated with runway 14-32, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 3 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 600.000 m on either

surfaces associated with runways 07-25 and 14-32, and are described as follows: the take-off/approach surface abutting the 07 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the projected centreline and an elevation being 300.000 m above the elevation at the end of the strip surface; the take-off/approach surface abutting the 25 end of the strip surface associated with runway 07-25, consisting of an inclined surface having a ratio of 1.000 m measured vertically to 50.000 m measured horizontally, rising to the outer edge of the take-off/approach surface drawn at right angles to the projected centreline of the strip surface and distant 15 000.000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer edge having a length of 2 400.000 m on either side of the
