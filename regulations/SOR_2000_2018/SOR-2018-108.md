| 10.0 minute | Conditions for grading A grader may grade a livestock carcass if the carcass bears a meat inspection stamp or, in the case of an imported beef carcass, the official inspection mark of the foreign state of origin; the grading takes place in the case of a bison carcass or ovine carcass, in the establishment that is identified in a licence, or the provincial establishment, where the animal was slaughtered, in the case of a veal carcass, in the establishment that is identified in a licence, or the provincial establishment, where the animal was slaughtered or where the carcass was divided into primal cuts or sub-primal cuts, or in the case of a beef carcass, in the establishment that is identified in a licence, or the provincial establishment, where the animal was slaughtered or in the establishment that is identified in a licence where the carcass was divided into primal cuts or sub-primal cuts; the carcass has been weighed by a weighmaster using a scale that is approved under section 3 of the  Weights and Measures Act ; the carcass is presented for grading at a grading stand where the lighting intensity, measured at the level of the grading stand, is at least 1 000 lx, or in a cooler where the lighting intensity, measured at the loin level of the carcass, is at least 200 lx; at least 10 minutes before grading, in the case of a beef carcass or bison carcass, an employee of the establishment performs, to the satisfaction of the grader, a knife-rib on the carcass, or in the case of a veal carcass, an employee of the establishment performs, to the satisfaction of the grader, a cut on the lean of the brisket to enable the grader to determine the colour reading of the veal carcass; the establishment has adequate equipment and facilities for weighing and grading livestock carcasses; and the grading equipment is functioning properly and is accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
