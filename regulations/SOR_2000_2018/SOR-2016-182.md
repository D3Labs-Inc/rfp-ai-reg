# Summary
2016-609 His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, pursuant to section 37 of the  Canada Consumer Product Safety Act a , makes the annexed  Matches Regulations .
Breaking resistance of splints When tested in accordance with Schedule 2, the splint of a match must withstand the following moments without breaking: in the case of a wood match, 700 gf∙cm; in the case of a round match other than a wood match, 100 gf∙cm; and in any other case, 300 gf∙cm, when the match is placed on its edge, and 100 gf∙cm, when the match is placed flat.
The following method is to be used for testing the breaking resistance of splints: insert the match in the holding clamp of the apparatus as illustrated in the figure, while ensuring that the moment arm is 2 cm in length, in the case of wood matches; or 1.5 cm in length, in the case of matches other than wood matches; gradually lower the holding clamp until the match breaks; and record the maximum force registered on the scale required to break the splint.

| 2 hour     | The following method is to be used for testing the spontaneous ignition of matches: place, on a flat surface, a wooden block that is 22 mm thick and 50 mm 2  that has a hole that is 25 mm in diameter; fill the hole in the block with the matches to be tested, so that the base of each match is resting on the flat surface, with the match heads pointing up; place the block in the centre of a convection oven at a temperature of 90 ± 1°C; place a temperature sensing device having a range of  65 to 120°C at a minimum distance of 6.5 mm and a maximum distance of 12 mm from, and at the same level as, the match heads; and leave the matches in the oven for a minimum period of two hours. |
