# Summary
Assignment of non-default NO x  emission value A NO x  emission value that is different from the default NO x  emission value set out in subsection  66 (2) may be assigned to a pre-existing engine, or a replacement unit that is a modern engine, if its NO x  emission intensity — determined by means of the most recent performance test conducted on the engine and expressed in the same units, ppmvd 15%  or g/kWh, that are selected under paragraph  65 (1)(c) for the subgroup to which the engine belongs — does not exceed that different NO x  emission value; and the responsible person referred to in subsection  66 (1) has registered the engine under subsection  97 (3) and provides the Minister with that different NO x  emission value for inclusion in the engine registry.

| 1 hour       | Regular-use engines Every engine that has operated for at least one hour during a year is a regular-use engine unless an election is in effect to have the engine be low-use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30.0 day     | Obligations under an election An engine for which an election is in effect must have a non-resettable hour meter, another non-resettable device or a SCADA system to determine the number of hours that the engine operates installed by the day on which the notice is provided, if the election takes effect in the year in which the notice is provided, and by January 1 of the year as of which the election is to take effect, in any other case; have the meter, device or SCADA system operating continuously, other than during periods when it is undergoing normal servicing or timely repairs, as of the day referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii), whichever applies; if a non-resettable hour meter or another non-resettable device is installed, have readings taken from the meter or device that are recorded along with the dates of the readings and the serial number — or, if the serial number is not known or cannot be obtained, the unique alphanumeric identifier — make and model of the engine within the shortest feasible period before or after the day on which the notice is provided, if the election takes effect in the year in which the notice is provided, every subsequent January 1, and the day on which the election ceases to be in effect; if a SCADA system is installed, have a record made — as of the day referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii), whichever applies, and until the day on which the election ceases to be in effect — from the SCADA system at least once every 30 days that contains data, taken every five minutes, that is used to determine the number of hours that the engine has operated, the dates on which that data was taken, and data that can be used to identify the serial number — or, if the serial number is not known or cannot be obtained, the unique alphanumeric identifier — make and model of the engine; and for each period of three consecutive years that begins with the year as of which the election takes effect, operate, excluding any hour of operation during an emergency, for fewer than 1,314 hours, as determined based on the records referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) and, if applicable, paragraph (1)(a).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 12.0 month   | Performance tests In addition to a performance test referred to in section  69 , a performance test to determine the NO x  emission intensity, expressed in ppmvd 15%  or g/kWh, of a regular-use engine must be conducted within 12 months after the first hour of its operation after it first becomes a regular-use engine, if it is a modern engine that has a rated brake power of at least 75 kW; within 12 months after any of sections  57  to  59  first applies in respect of the engine; within 90 days after a person becomes, on a given date, an owner of an engine that is subject to a NO x  emission intensity limit referred to in any of sections  54  and  57  to  59 , if they do not have a record of the information referred to in paragraph  100 (i) and section 6 of Schedule 10 in respect of the most recent performance test, if any, conducted on the engine, and that given date occurs less than 90 days before the end of the 12-month period referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), or after the end of that 12-month period; and before an assignment, by a responsible person under subsection  67 (1), of a NO x  emission value to an engine that is different from its default NO x  emission value described in subsection  66 (2), if the NO x  emission value that they propose to assign is lower than the NO x  emission intensity for the engine determined by means of the most recent performance test conducted on the engine, or that responsible person does not have a record of the information referred to in paragraph  100 (i) and section 6 of Schedule 10 in respect of that most recent performance test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 20.0 minute  | Analyzer — set-up Before a calibration error check or an emissions check is conducted in a given location, the measurement system must be verified to have no leaks; if applicable, the measurement system must be verified to have sufficient scrubbing agent in good working order to conduct the check; after those verifications, the analyzer must be turned on at that location for the longer of 20 minutes, and the period that is necessary for the temperature of the NO electrochemical cell to be within 2°C of ambient air temperature; and after the end of the applicable period described in paragraph (c), the analyzer must be zeroed at that location by using the zeroing function of the analyzer, or turning it off and on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 90.0 day     | Operating conditions for emissions checks The emissions check must be conducted while the engine is operating with a rated brake power that is at most 10% below the brake power at which it operated most of the time during the previous 90 days, if that brake power during that time is at least 50% of its rated brake power, and that is at least 40% of its rated brake power, in any other case; and not operating during start-up, shutdown or a period of malfunction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 12.0 month   | Annual audit For each year during which a responsible person uses a CEMS to determine a NO x  emission intensity under Part 1 or a quantity of emissions under section  106 , the responsible person must ensure that an auditor evaluates whether, in the auditor’s opinion, the responsible person has complied with the CEMS Reference Method and, in particular, whether the CEMS has met the specifications set out in the CEMS Reference Method; the results of each relative accuracy test and each bias test for each of the relative accuracy test audits (RATA) for the 12 months preceding the auditor’s audit have not exceeded the applicable limit referred to in the CEMS Reference Method; and the responsible person has established a Quality Assurance/Quality Control manual that complies with Section 6.0 of the EC CEMS Code or a Quality Assurance Plan that complies with Section 5.1 of the Alberta CEMS Code and, if so, whether the responsible person has implemented it, its implementation ensures that the data generated by the CEMS is complete, accurate and precise, and it has been updated in accordance with the CEMS Reference Method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 2011-01-01 | Classification NO x  emission intensity — on registration The classification NO x  emission intensity of a pre-existing boiler or heater — in respect of which this Part applies on the day on which these Regulations are registered and that has not undergone a major modification since that day — must, during the reference period that consists of the 12-month period that begins on that day, be determined by means of a stack test, or a CEMS test, with that determination being the greatest of the rolling hourly averages determined in respect of each averaging period in the reference period; or by means of a record made of the assignment of the following classification NO x  emission intensity to the boiler or heater in question: a NO x  emission intensity that results from a determination by means of a stack test conducted in the period that begins on January 1, 2011 and ends on the day before the day on which these Regulations are registered, in accordance with sections  27  to  31 , on the boiler or heater in question, if since that determination none of the burners of that boiler or heater has been replaced, no burner has been added to that boiler or heater, and that boiler or heater has not been relocated, or on the boiler or heater in question or another boiler or heater, if that determination is at least 70 g/GJ, since that determination but before the end of that period, the boiler or heater in question has undergone a major modification that involves the use of combustion modification techniques referred to in subsection  14 (3), and in the case that the stack test was conducted on the other boiler or heater, the conditions set out in paragraphs (2)(a) to (f) were met by the boiler or heater in question and that other boiler or heater when the stack test was conducted, 40 g/GJ, if a responsible person for the boiler or heater in question has a record of information that establishes that there is no equipment installed that allows for a stack test or CEMS test to be conducted on it, and that boiler or heater is designed to have a NO x  emission intensity of less than 40 g/GJ if its NO x  emission intensity were determined by means of a stack test conducted while it meets the conditions set out in paragraphs  27 (2)(a) to (e), 40 g/GJ, if the boiler or heater in question has a rated capacity of at most 262.5 GJ/h and it has been identified under subsection (3) with another boiler or heater, and the classification NO x  emission intensity of that other boiler or heater is determined by means of a stack test under subparagraph (a)(i) to be less than 40 g/GJ, 40 g/GJ, if the boiler or heater in question has been identified under subsection (3) with another boiler or heater, and the classification NO x  emission intensity of that other boiler or heater is determined by means of a CEMS test under subparagraph (a)(ii) to be less than 40 g/GJ, 40 g/GJ, if the boiler or heater in question has a rated capacity of at most 262.5 GJ/h and it shares a common stack with at most four other boiler or heaters, it has been identified under subsection (3) with each of those other boilers or heaters, and the NO x  emission intensity at the common stack is, in respect of that reference period, determined to be less than 40 g/GJ by means of a stack test whose test runs are conducted while each of the boilers or heaters sharing the common stack meets the conditions set out in paragraphs  27 (2)(a) to (e), or by means of a CEMS test, or 80 g/GJ, if a responsible person for the boiler or heater in question elects to assign that classification NO x  emission intensity to it.

| 2018-01-01 | Obligations under an election An engine for which an election is in effect must have a non-resettable hour meter, another non-resettable device or a SCADA system to determine the number of hours that the engine operates installed by the day on which the notice is provided, if the election takes effect in the year in which the notice is provided, and by January 1 of the year as of which the election is to take effect, in any other case; have the meter, device or SCADA system operating continuously, other than during periods when it is undergoing normal servicing or timely repairs, as of the day referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii), whichever applies;

if a SCADA system is installed, have a record made — as of the day referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii), whichever applies, and until the day on which the election ceases to be in effect — from the SCADA system at least once every 30 days that contains data, taken every five minutes, that is used to determine the number of hours that the engine has operated, the dates on which that data was taken, and data that can be used to identify the serial number — or, if the serial number is not known or cannot be obtained, the unique alphanumeric identifier — make and model of the engine; and for each period of three consecutive years that begins with the year as of which the election takes effect, operate, excluding any hour of operation during an emergency, for fewer than 1,314 hours, as determined based on the records referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) and, if applicable, paragraph (1)(a).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

and for each period of three consecutive years that begins with the year as of which the election takes effect, operate, excluding any hour of operation during an emergency, for fewer than 1,314 hours, as determined based on the records referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) and, if applicable, paragraph (1)(a).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 2018-10-31 | Election The responsible person must — by the October 31 immediately before the first year in respect of which the limit referred to in section  60  is to apply — make the election by providing the Minister with the following information for inclusion in the engine registry for each subgroup that they establish under section  65 : the serial number — or, if the serial number is not known or cannot be obtained, the unique alphanumeric identifier — of each pre-existing engine and replacement unit that belongs to the subgroup; and each NO x  emission value, if any, that is assigned under section  67  to a pre-existing engine, or a replacement unit that is a modern engine, that belongs to the subgroup.

by means of a log of operations used to make a record in respect of the ith engine or replacement unit at least once every 30 days during that year that contains data related to the number of hours that it has operated on each day since any previous record, the dates of those days, its make, model and serial number or, if the serial number is not known or cannot be obtained, unique alphanumeric identifier, and the initials of the person making the record; or by means of a SCADA system used to make a record in respect of the ith engine or replacement unit at least once every 30 days during that year that contains data that is taken every 15 minutes and used to determine the number of hours that it has operated, the dates on which that data was taken, and data that can be used to identify its make, model and serial number or, if the serial number is not known or cannot be obtained, unique alphanumeric identifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 6522-11-01 | Sampling ports The location of the sampling port, and its traverse points, in the exhaust pipe for each test run must be determined in accordance with EPA Method 1 or EPA Method 1A, as applicable; ASTM D6522-11; or EC Method A. Pre-existing engines without sampling port If a pre-existing engine does not have a sampling port that meets the requirements of any of those methods, each test run must be conducted at a single traverse point that is located at the centre of the exhaust pipe at a distance from the engine of at least twice the diameter of that pipe; and have the NO x  emission intensity of the engine expressed in ppmvd 15% .
