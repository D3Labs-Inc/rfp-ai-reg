# Summary
CRIMINAL CODE Nova Scotia Rules of Practice Respecting Applications and Hearings Concerning a Reduction in the Number of Years of Imprisonment without Eligibility for Parole.
( juge ) local prothonotary  means the prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for the county in which a pre-hearing conference or hearing in respect of an application takes place.
On receipt of a notice referred to in paragraph (1)(b), the Attorney General shall cause a written notice of the date and place of the pre-hearing conference to be sent by registered mail or any other accepted means of service to the applicant; the Solicitor General of Canada; and the officer in charge of the institution where the applicant is being detained.
