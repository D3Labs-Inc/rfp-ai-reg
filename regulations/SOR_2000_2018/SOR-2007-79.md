# Summary
Interpretation For greater certainty, nothing in these Regulations confers any legislative power on any person or body; a person or body that has a power, duty or function — other than a legislative power — under the laws of Alberta specified in Schedule 1 has the same power, duty or function under these Regulations, subject to the adaptations specified in Schedule 2; a body or fund referred to in these Regulations is the same body or fund constituted under the applicable law of Alberta specified in Schedule 1; nothing in these Regulations affects the application or interpretation of agreements between Canada and Alberta regarding cooperative environmental assessments; where a law that applies with respect to the project lands under section 3 refers to a law that is adapted by these Regulations, the reference shall be read as a reference to the law as adapted; and in Schedule 1, a reference to regulations made under an Act includes all regulations made under that Act after the coming into force of these Regulations, unless excepted in Schedule 1 or 2.
Adaptations to the Administrative Procedures and Jurisdiction Act. Statutory power In the definition of  statutory power  in section 1(c), a reference to “statute” shall be read as a reference to a statute of Alberta that applies with respect to the project lands by virtue of these Regulations.
