| 90.0 day    | Types of wastewater systems For the purpose of these Regulations, there are two types of wastewater systems, as follows: an intermittent wastewater system, namely, one with a hydraulic retention time of at least 90 days that deposits effluent via its final discharge point during at most four periods per calendar year, each of which is separated from every other period by at least seven clear days during which no deposit occurs; and a continuous wastewater system, namely, any wastewater system other than an intermittent wastewater system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

record that contains the following information: for the final discharge point, the date of each day on which effluent was not deposited via the final discharge point, the date of each day on which effluent was deposited via the final discharge point, and for each of the days referred to in subparagraph (ii) for a wastewater system whose daily volume of effluent referred to in paragraph  7 (1)(a) was determined using monitoring equipment referred to in section  9 the daily volume of the effluent, expressed in m 3 , if that volume is yielded by a continuous measure, and the estimated daily volume, expressed in m 3 , as determined in accordance with subsection  7 (3) and the results of the measurement and the calculation referred to in paragraphs  7 (3)(a) and (b), in any other case, and for an intermittent wastewater system whose daily volume of effluent referred to in paragraph  7 (1)(a) was determined using a method of estimation in accordance with subsection  7 (4), the estimated daily volume, expressed in m 3 , and the average daily volume of effluent deposited annually, expressed in m 3 , determined in accordance with subsection  8 (1), if applicable; for each combined sewer overflow point via which effluent is deposited because of precipitation, including the melting of snow or ice, that resulted in excess wastewater in the wastewater system, the date of each day on which effluent was deposited via the overflow point, for each of those days, the duration or estimated duration, expressed in hours, of the deposit, along with an indication of whether it is the duration or an estimated duration and the daily volume of the effluent deposited, expressed in m 3 , if that volume is yielded by a continuous measure, and the estimated daily volume of the effluent deposited, expressed in m 3 , in any other case, the volume or estimated volume, expressed in m 3 , of effluent for each month during which effluent was deposited via the overflow point, and the number of days in each of those months during which effluent was deposited via the overflow point; for any monitoring equipment referred to in section  9 , a description, including its type, if applicable, the manufacturer’s specifications, the year of manufacture and the model number, each date on which the equipment was calibrated and its degree of accuracy after each calibration, and the

| 2014-06-30 | Transitional authorization The owner or operator of a wastewater system may, on or before June 30, 2014, apply to an authorization officer for a transitional authorization to deposit via the final discharge point effluent that contains a deleterious substance prescribed in section  5 , or any combination of those substances, if the average referred to in paragraph  6 (1)(a) or (b), as determined in accordance with subsection  6 (3), exceeded 25 mg/L during the following periods: any period of 12 consecutive months during the 15 months immediately before the day on which the application is made, if the wastewater system deposited, during the previous calendar year in respect of that period of 12 consecutive months, an average daily volume of effluent via its final discharge point of less than or equal to 17 500 m 3 , for an intermittent wastewater system, or less than or equal to 2 500 m 3 , for a continuous wastewater system with a hydraulic retention time of five or more days; any three consecutive months in any of those periods of 12 consecutive months, if the wastewater system deposited, during the previous calendar year in respect of that period of 12 consecutive months, an average daily volume of effluent via its final discharge point of greater than 2 500 m 3  and less than or equal to 17 500 m 3 , for a continuous wastewater system with a hydraulic retention time of five or more days, and less than or equal to 17 500 m 3 , for any other continuous wastewater system; and any three months in any of those periods of 12 consecutive months, if the wastewater system deposited, during the previous calendar year in respect of that period of 12 consecutive months, an average daily volume of effluent via its final discharge point of greater than 17 500 m 3 .

| 2015-01-01 | Required information Subject to subsection (2), the authorization officer must issue the temporary authorization to deposit effluent that contains un-ionized ammonia for a period of three years from January 1, 2015, or the date of issuance if that date is later, if the application contains the information required under section  35 ; the information referred to in paragraph  35 (e) has established that the effluent was, at the time of the application, acutely lethal because of the concentration of un-ionized ammonia in it; and the information referred to in paragraph  35 (f) has established that the concentration of un-ionized ammonia in the water, determined in accordance with subsection  34 (3), at any point that is 100 m from the point of entry where effluent was deposited in that water via the final discharge point was less than or equal to 0.016 mg/L, expressed as nitrogen (N).
