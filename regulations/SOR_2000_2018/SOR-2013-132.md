# Summary
Acknowledgement I understand that even if the future investment performance equals or exceeds the return that was expected, it is possible that the income produced following the transfer of the assets of the plan will be insufficient to provide the same lifetime retirement income that I, or my spouse or common-law partner, if applicable, would otherwise have received if I had not elected to make the transfer.
I understand that my spouse or common-law partner has elected to transfer the assets of the Aveos Fleet Performance Inc. pension plan, (certificate of registration number 57573 issued by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and Canada Revenue Agency registration number 1198944),  that are attributable to him or her, and that my written consent is required to enable my spouse or common-law partner to do so.

| 90.0 day   | I understand that (a) the transferred funds may be used to purchase a life annuity at a later date; (b) if the transferred funds are used to purchase a life annuity, the life annuity must be in the joint and survivor form unless I waive my entitlements by signing a separate waiver form within 90 days before the start of the annuity; (c) a transfer of the assets of the plan into a life income fund under the  Aveos Pension Plan Regulations  will allow my spouse or common-law partner to withdraw some of the money each year, subject to minimum and maximum withdrawal limits as prescribed by the  Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985  and the  Income Tax Act ; (d) the amount of pension income or the amount available to me on the death of my spouse or common-law partner may be significantly reduced if (i) my spouse or common-law partner elects to withdraw the maximum amount permitted each year, or (ii) the investment performance is lower than expected; and it is possible that the income produced following the transfer of the assets of the plan will be insufficient to provide the same lifetime retirement income I would otherwise have received had my spouse or common-law partner not elected to make the transfer.
