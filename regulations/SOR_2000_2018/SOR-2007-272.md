# Summary
Factors that must be considered Each environmental assessment of a project shall consider the following factors: the environmental effects of the project, including the environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the project, and any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities that have been or will be undertaken; the significance of those environmental effects; any comments from the public that are received in accordance with the first nation’s oil and gas law; technically and economically feasible measures that would mitigate any significant adverse environmental effects of the project; and any other matter relevant to a screening, comprehensive study, mediation or assessment by a review panel, such as the need for the project and alternatives to the project, whose consideration may be required by the decision-making authority or, except in the case of a screening, the council of the first nation.
Time for decision A decision-making authority shall not make any decision under subsection 16(1) before the 15th day after the day on which the following are posted on the Internet site referred to in section 49: the notice of the commencement of the environmental assessment process; the description of the scope of the project; and if the decision-making authority gives the public an opportunity to examine and comment on the screening report and any record relating to the project that has been included in the registry, the description of the factors to be considered in the environmental assessment and their scope, or an indication of how a copy of the description may be obtained.
