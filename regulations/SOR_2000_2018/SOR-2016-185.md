# Summary
after-flame time  means the length of time a wall and top material, tested in accordance with the procedure set out in section 3 of Schedule 1, continues to flame after the ignition source has been removed.
Flooring material When a sample unit of flooring material is prepared and tested in accordance with the procedures set out in Schedule 1, none of the specimens of the sample unit is to display any damage within 25 mm of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame.
Wall and top material When a sample unit of wall and top material is prepared and tested in accordance with the procedures set out in Schedule 1, none of the specimens of the sample unit is to have an after-flame time that exceeds four seconds and the average after-flame time of those specimens is not to exceed two seconds; the damaged length of each specimen of the sample unit and the average damaged length of those specimens are not to exceed the lengths set out in the table to this section; and none of the specimens of the sample unit is to have any portions that break, or residues that drip, from the specimen and that continue to flame after reaching the floor of the test cabinet.
