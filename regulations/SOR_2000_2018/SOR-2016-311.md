| 2014-06-01 | Calculation of CEER In respect of a room air conditioner that is manufactured on or after June 1, 2014, compliance with the energy efficiency standard is to be determined by calculating the CEER in accordance with one of the following formulae: if the product has standby mode or off mode, but not both, the CEER must be calculated as follows: CEER = (3 412 × A × 750) / (B × 750 + C × 5 115) where A is the product’s cooling capacity, expressed in kilowatts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C368.1 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108, B is the product’s on mode power, expressed in watts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C368.1 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108, and C is the product’s standby mode power or off mode power, as applicable, expressed in watts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C62301 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108; or if the product has both standby mode and off mode, the CEER must be calculated as follows: CEER = (3 412 × A × 750) / (B × 750 + C × 2 557.5 + D × 2 557.5) where A is the product’s cooling capacity, expressed in kilowatts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C368.1 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108, B is the product’s on mode power, expressed in watts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C368.1 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108, C is the product’s standby mode power, expressed in watts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C62301 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108, and D is the product’s off mode power, expressed in watts, derived by testing the product in accordance with testing procedures established by CSA C62301 that are applicable to a  room air conditioner  as defined in section 108.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
