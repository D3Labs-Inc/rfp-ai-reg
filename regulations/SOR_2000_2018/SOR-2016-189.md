# Summary
The following method is to be used for testing the strength of the mesh and the integrity of its attachment to the playpen: assemble the playpen in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions; place the playpen on its side so that it lies in a horizontal plane, and use any blocking or support necessary to maintain that position so long as the blocking or support does not act directly on the frame of the side being tested; apply a load of 9.18 kg that has a rectangular base measuring 150 mm × 75 mm to the geometric centre of the mesh panel or, if any exterior framing interferes with the test, as close as possible to the geometric centre so that the 150 mm dimension of the load is aligned parallel to the top rail of the side that is being tested, in the following manner: gradually apply the load over a period of one second, leave the load in place for 10 seconds, gradually remove the load over a period of one second, and allow a recovery time of 10 seconds; repeat the steps set out in paragraph (c) nine times for a total of 10 applications; repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) on the top portion of the mesh panel in the following manner: align the load so that the 75 mm dimension is parallel with the top edge of the mesh panel, and apply the load to the mesh panel so that the centre of that dimension is between 25 mm and 50 mm below the centre of the top edge; and repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) on the bottom portion of the mesh panel in the following manner: align the load so that the 75 mm dimension is parallel with the bottom edge of the mesh panel, and apply the load to the mesh panel so that the centre of that dimension is between 25 mm and 50 mm above the centre of the bottom edge.
