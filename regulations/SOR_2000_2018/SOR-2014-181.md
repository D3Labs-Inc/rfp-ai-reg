# Summary
Whereas the Minister of Industry is of the opinion that the Rome Convention or WPPT countries referred to in the annexed Statement do not grant a right of remuneration, similar in scope and duration to that provided by subsections 19(1.1) a  and (1.2) b  of the  Copyright Act c , for the performance in public or the communication to the public by telecommunication of a sound recording whose maker, at the date of its first fixation, was a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the  Immigration and Refugee Protection Act d  or was a corporation that had its headquarters in Canada; S.C. 2012, c.
Costa Rica In the case of a sound recording whose maker, at the date of its first fixation, was a citizen or permanent resident of Costa Rica or was a corporation that had its headquarters in that country, a right to equitable remuneration does not apply to a broadcast that is lawful under the  Broadcasting Act , by a terrestrial radio station, of a signal that carries the sound recording for reception that is free and does not require a subscription; or the performance of the sound recording in public as part of a non-commercial activity.
