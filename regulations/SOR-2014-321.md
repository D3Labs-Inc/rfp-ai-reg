# Summary
Application This Order establishes the method for allocating the quantity of softwood lumber products that may be exported during a month from each of Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan for the purpose of paragraph 6.3(3)(a) of the Act. Relinquishing export allocation For the purposes of this Order, a primary producer or remanufacturer relinquishes its export allocation for a given year by so informing the Minister in writing no later than 21 days before the beginning of the year in which the export allocation would have applied.
Allocation to remanufacturers Subject to subsection (2), the allocation of the Quebec quantity to a remanufacturer that is based on its historic export volume is determined by the formula QQ × (RE/TEQ) where QQ is the Quebec quantity; RE is the volume of the remanufacturer’s products that were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period; and TEQ is the total volume of primary producers’ and remanufacturers’ products that were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period, excluding the volume of products of primary producers and remanufacturers who relinquish their export allocations in accordance with section 3.
