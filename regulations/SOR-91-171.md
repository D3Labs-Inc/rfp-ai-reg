The airport reference point shown on Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2634 dated May 2, 1988, is a point located on the centre line of runway 124-304 distant 457.0 m from the threshold of runway 304.
The outer surface, shown on Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2634 dated May 2, 1988, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2634 dated May 2, 1988, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.

| 1988-05-02 | The outer surface, shown on Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2634 dated May 2, 1988, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
