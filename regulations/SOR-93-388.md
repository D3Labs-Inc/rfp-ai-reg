# Summary
Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point, shown on Fort Norman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2969 dated January 30, 1992, is a point located on the centre line of runway 05-23 distant 457 m from the threshold of runway 23.
The outer surface, shown on Fort Norman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2969 dated January 30, 1992, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Fort Norman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2969, dated January 30, 1992, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
