# Summary
Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a pensioner who was granted a pension as an officer and who is absent from duty for any purpose including absence on leave without pay and allowances, or secondment where he performs continuous full-time service or employment and receives emoluments by way of pay and allowances, salary or otherwise for that service or employment, shall contribute to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in respect of any period during which he is so absent, by making payments in accordance with subsection (2) and that period shall be counted as service for the purposes of section 9 as being augmenting service.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions contained in sections 5 to 11, a pensioner shall be deemed not to have elected to count augmenting service where he ceases to serve on a full-time paid basis in the forces or in the naval, army or air forces of Canada or the Canadian Forces, other than the forces, prior to completion of a period of augmenting service, as described in paragraph 5(1)(a); or he is not entitled to have his pension computed upon the pensionable term pursuant to subsection 9(1).
