# Summary
FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT Order Granting Remission of Taxes Payable in Respect of Persons Involuntarily Retired from the Public Service.
Where, in the 1972 or any subsequent taxation year, a settlement was or is received by an employee or his legal representative because of the termination of employment, remission is hereby granted of the amount by which the income tax payable by him or his legal representative for the taxation year exceeds the aggregate of the tax that would have been payable by him or his legal representative for the taxation year if the settlement had not been received, and the tax that, if the salary or pension in respect of which the settlement was paid had in fact been received by him or his legal representative in the taxation years in respect of which the settlement was paid, would have been payable less the tax that was so paid in respect of those years together with the interest, if any, payable on that amount.
