# Summary
No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point the approach surfaces; the outer surface; or the transitional surfaces.
The airport reference point shown on Kindersley Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2713 dated February 23, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 07-25 distant 533.5 m from the end of runway 25.
The outer surface, shown on Kindersley Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2713 dated February 23, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
