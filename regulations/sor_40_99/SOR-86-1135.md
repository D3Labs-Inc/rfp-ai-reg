# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Public Works Canada Deer Lake Airport Zoning Plans S-441-3, S-441-4, S-441-5 and S-441-6, dated November 30, 1984, is determined by measuring 975.36 m southwesterly along the centre line and centre line produced of runway 07-25 from the 07 end of the strip and thence measuring northwesterly at right angles 152.40 m from the centre line of the said runway 07-25.
The outer surface, shown on Public Works Canada Deer Lake Airport Zoning Plans S-441-3, S-441-4, S-441-5 and S-441-6, dated November 30, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Public Works Canada Deer Lake Airport Zoning Plans S-441-3, S-441-4, S-441-5 and S-441-6, dated November 30, 1984, is a circular area having a radius of 4 000 m from the airport reference point.
