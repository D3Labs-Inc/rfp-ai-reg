class H-120 divisions; all control stations shall be separated from other areas by class A-60 divisions; the accommodation areas shall be separated from other areas by class A-60 divisions; every machinery space and every storeroom containing paint, oil, any gaseous substance or other flammable material shall be separated from galleys or accommodation areas by class A-60 divisions and from each other by class A-0 divisions; galley supply and exhaust ventilator trunking within the accommodation areas or any other enclosed spaces shall be made of steel covered with a fire-resistant insulation material of a type and thickness equivalent to that in a class A-60 division; every deck and its supporting structure within the accommodation areas that is not required to be a class A-60 division shall be constructed of material that by itself or due to insulation provided will not lose its structural stability and fire integrity when subjected to a 60 minute standard fire test; every corridor bulkhead that is not required to be a class A-60 division shall be a class B-15 division and extend from deck to deck or, when continuous class B-15 divisions that are ceilings are fitted, from the deck to the continuous ceiling; every door in every class B-15 division that is a bulkhead shall meet the standard for a class B-15 division, except that a door to a cabin or to a public space other than a stairway may have ventilation openings or a louvre in the lower half; no door of a division forming any part of a stairway enclosure shall be provided with ventilation openings or louvres; every opening in every bulkhead and deck in the accommodation areas shall have permanently attached to it a means of closing that will maintain the fire integrity of the bulkheads and decks; where a class A-0 division, class A-60 division, class B-15 division or class H-120 division is pierced for the passage of electric cables, pipes, trunks or structural elements or for other purposes, arrangements shall be made so that the fire resistance of the division is not impaired; air spaces enclosed behind ceilings, panelling or linings shall be divided by close-fitting draught stops that are spaced not more than 14 m apart and that are fitted transversely if the length of the space exceeds 14 m and lengthwise if the width exceeds 14 m; every internal stairwell, ladderwell and crew elevator trunk within the accommodation areas shall be constructed of steel or equivalent material; every stairwell in the accommodation areas shall be enclosed within a trunk constructed of class A-60 divisions and shall have self-closing doors, except that a stairwell connecting only two decks need only be fitted at one deck level with a division that has the same fire integrity and structural stability as the deck and self-closing doors; for compartments that contain or are affected by oil and oil vapour, the surface of insulating materials fitted to the inside of bulkheads and decks and forming the casings and crowns shall be impervious to oil and oil vapour; every door and shutter in a bulkhead opening to hatches in the galley and pantry shall be constructed so that the fire integrity of the bulkhead is maintained, and shall be capable of being readily closed from a position outside the galley or pantry; primary deck coverings shall be of a type that will not readily ignite; paints, veneers and other finishes used on surfaces on concealed or inaccessible spaces and on exposed surfaces, except furniture, furnishings and floor coverings, shall be such that the surfaces are of a low flame spread type; overboard scuppers, sanitary discharges or other outlets close to the water shall be of material unlikely to fail in the event of fire; every load-bearing steel structural element shall be fire protected; and blast-resistant panels and explosion venting systems shall be provided in locations that are susceptible to an explosion.
