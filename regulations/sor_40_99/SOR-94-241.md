# Summary
Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excessive growth.
Each transitional surface, shown on Halifax International Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-2449-14, S-2449-23 to S-2449-25 inclusive and S-2449-30, dated March 30, 1990, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
The outer limit, shown on Halifax International Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-2449-13 to S-2449-15 inclusive, S-2449-23 to S-2449-25 inclusive and S-2449-29 to S-2449-31 inclusive, dated March 30, 1990, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
