# Summary
The Minister may have the fair market value of an object or appurtenance that is the subject of an application for an indemnity agreement reviewed, in which case the procedure set out in section 14 shall apply, with any modifications that the circumstances require.
If the Minister determines that a claim is valid and that the loss is total, the Minister shall pay the amount of the claim to the owner in accordance with the terms of the indemnity agreement; or the loss or damage is partial and the Minister agrees with the consequent reduction in the fair market value of the object or appurtenance as set out in the claim, the Minister shall pay the amount of the claim to the owner, in accordance with the terms of the indemnity agreement, or subject to the written agreement of the owner, have the object or appurtenance restored to the condition described in the report referred to in section 10.
If the Minister and the owner agree on the extent of the partial loss or damage and the consequent reduction in the fair market value of an object or appurtenance, based on the determinations of the appraisers made under subsection (1), the Minister shall act in accordance with subparagraph 12(b)(i) or (ii).
