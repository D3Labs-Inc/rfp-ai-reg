No railway company shall permit a train having occupied service equipment cars to exceed a speed of 56.31 km (35 miles) per hour at any time.
A railway company shall, within two years after the date of the coming into force and these Regulations, provide each occupied service equipment car with a means of voice communication with the train crew in other parts of the train or with an emergency brake valve.
A railway company shall protect occupied service equipment cars placed in sidings, back tracks or other tracks against other train movements by issuing a train order in accordance with the second sentence of Rule 203 of the  Regulations No. 0-8, Uniform Code of Operating Rules  or a Manual Block System Bulletin pursuant to Rule 323 of the said Regulations; spiking the switches of back tracks and other tracks; and where practicable, spiking the switches of sidings.
