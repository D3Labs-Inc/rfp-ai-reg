| 1978-11-02 | Being a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of one (1) metre measured vertically to seven (7) metres measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an elevation of forty-five (45) metres, measured vertically,
