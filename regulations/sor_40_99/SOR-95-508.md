# Summary
1 Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 5.4 **  of the  Aeronautics Act , is pleased hereby to make the annexed  Regulations respecting the zoning at Faro Airport .
Where an object of natural growth that is on land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excess growth.
The airport reference point, shown on Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043, dated March 9, l995, is a point located on the centre line of runway 08-26 at a distance of 609.5 m from the threshold of runway 08.
Each transitional surface, shown on Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043, dated March 9, 1995, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to a height of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point.
