# Summary
Where, in the opinion of the Board, a manufacturer or a person who is about to engage in a manufacturing or processing activity in Canada requires a loan in order to take advantage of a new opportunity for the production of goods in Canada which will face significant international trade competition, or restructure his operations in a manner that will significantly improve his position in meeting international trade competition, and is unable to obtain sufficient financing on reasonable terms unless the loan is insured by the Board, the Board may, on behalf of Her Majesty, provide insurance on a loan made to such manufacturer or person by a private lender for the purposes stated in this subsection.
Where, in the opinion of the Board, a manufacturer requires a loan in order to adjust to changes in conditions affecting his access to foreign markets, which conditions are attributable to the imposition by a country other than Canada of a temporary import surtax or to the taking by such country of other actions having a like effect, or adapt efficiently to competition from goods imported at such prices, in such quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause him serious injury, and is unable to obtain sufficient financing on reasonable terms unless the loan is insured by the Board, the Board may, on behalf of Her Majesty, provide insurance on a loan made to such manufacturer by a private lender for the purposes stated in this subsection.
