# Summary
It is a condition of a development incentive in respect of a facility that if, during the 30 months immediately following the day on which the facility is brought into commercial production, in the case of a facility in respect of which the development incentive is based only on the approved capital costs, or during the 42 months immediately following the day on which the facility is brought into commercial production, in the case of a facility in respect of which the development incentive is based in part on the number of jobs created in the operation, the facility or part of the facility is destroyed by fire, flood or other act beyond the control of the applicant, the applicant shall pay to Her Majesty such amount of the insurance proceeds as may be determined by the Minister to be the same proportion of the whole of the insurance proceeds as the development incentive paid in respect of the destroyed assets is of the aggregate of the approved capital costs of the destroyed eligible assets and the book value of other destroyed assets in respect of which the insurance is paid.
