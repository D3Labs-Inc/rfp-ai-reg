# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a), (b) and (c), the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The strips, shown on Earlton Airport Zoning Plan No. 54-090-83-158, Sheet 5, dated June 26, 1984, are described as follows: the strip associated with runway 07-25 is 300 m in width, 150 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 949 m in length; the strip associated with runway 16-34 is 90 m in width, 45 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 040 m in length.
Each transitional surface, shown on Earlton Airport Zoning Plan No. 54-090-83-158, Sheets 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, dated June 26, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2018-01-09 | The outer surface, shown on Earlton Airport Zoning Plan No. 54-090-83-158, Sheets 1 to 9, dated June 26, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, in which case the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1984-06-26 | The outer surface, shown on Earlton Airport Zoning Plan No. 54-090-83-158, Sheets 1 to 9, dated June 26, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, in which case the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
