# Summary
Content and time limit In relation to an application for an order respecting a remedy, the complainant may file a reply that sets out the arguments that he or she intends to make in rebuttal to facts or issues that were raised in another party’s statement of particulars.
Limits Except with leave of the Tribunal, a party is not permitted to do any of the following at the hearing: raise a position, seek to prove a material fact or to introduce a document that was not disclosed, or call a witness — other than an expert witness — who was not named, in its statement of particulars, reply or supplementary statement of particulars; introduce an expert report into evidence or call the expert as a witness if the expert report was not provided in accordance with Rules 26 to 28; and in the case of the Commissioner or the complainant, request any remedy or disciplinary action, as the case may be, that was not raised in its statement of particulars.
