# Summary
Before providing a person with a new primary financial or optional product or service, an institution must first obtain the person’s express consent to do so, either orally or in writing.
Before a person provides their express consent to receive an optional product or service from an institution, the institution must provide them, orally or in writing, with an initial disclosure statement that contains the information referred to in paragraphs 6(a) to (d) or a summary of that information.
Unless it has previously disclosed in writing the information required under this section, an institution that enters into an agreement with a person for an optional product or service must, within 30 days after entering into the agreement, provide the person with a subsequent disclosure statement containing all relevant information about the product or service, including: a description of the product or service; the term of the agreement; the charges for the product or service or the method for determining the charges and an example to illustrate the method; the conditions under which the person may cancel the product or service; the date from which the product or service is available for use and, if different, from which charges apply; and the steps required to use the product or service.
