The outer surface, shown on Holman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3038, dated October 6, 1994, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The strip associated with runway 062T-242T, shown on Holman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3038, dated October 6, 1994, is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 430.6 m in length.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Holman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3038, dated October 6, 1994, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
