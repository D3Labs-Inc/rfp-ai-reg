| 2018-10-06 | Exception These Regulations, except for sections  6  and  7 , do not apply to the packaging and transport of a nuclear substance that is naturally occurring, provided that it has a specific activity that is less than or equal to 70 kBq/kg, or an activity concentration that does not exceed 10 times the activity concentration limit for exempt material values set out in the IAEA Regulations; that was implanted in or administered to a person or an animal for medical diagnosis or treatment purposes, or that subsists in their remains; that is contained in a sample of material taken for bioassay purposes; that is used by a holder of a licence on private property for the purpose of an activity described in paragraphs 26(a) to (c) of the Act that the licence authorizes the holder to carry on, if access to the property is controlled; that is contained in human or animal tissue samples or animal remains, or a liquid scintillation medium, if the specific activity of the nuclear substance averaged over the mass of the material does not exceed 10 -6  A 2 /kg; that is contained in a product for which no licence is required under sections 6 to 8 of the  Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations  following the sale of the product to an end user; that is an integral part of a conveyance and is required for transport purposes; that has an activity concentration that does not exceed the values for an exempt material set out in the IAEA Regulations or in a certificate for a basic radionuclide value that is not listed in the IAEA Regulations; that is in a consignment that has a total activity that does not exceed the values for an activity limit for an exempt consignment set out in the IAEA Regulations, in a certificate for a basic radionuclide value that is not listed in the IAEA Regulations or in a certificate for an instrument or article that has an alternative activity limit for an exempt consignment; that is contained in a check source for which no licence is required under section 8.1 of the  Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations  following the sale of the check source to an end user; that is contained in a radiation device for which no licence is required under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the  Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations  following the sale of the device to an end user; that consists of non-radioactive solid objects with radioactive material present on any surface in quantities not exceeding 0.4 Bq/cm 2  for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters and 0.04 Bq/cm 2  for all other alpha emitters; that is in or on a person who is transported for medical treatment because the person has been subject to an accidental or deliberate intake or contamination; that is present in a load of waste that is in transport, is not classified as radioactive material and has triggered a radiation monitor alarm if the nuclear substance in the load has been determined only to be one or more of the following medical isotopes and if there is no loss or dispersal of the material during the transport: Chromium 51, Indium 111, Iodine 123, 124 or 131, Gallium 67, Technetium 99m, Thallium 201; that is being transported to a location for proper characterization in accordance with section  3 , if it is present in a load that was already in transport, it is not classified as radioactive material, it has triggered a radiation monitor alarm and the maximum dose rate on any external surface of the vehicle that is transporting it is less than or equal to 500 µSv/h, and there is no loss or dispersal of the material during the transport; or that is being transported by a peace officer to a location for proper characterization, if it is a forensic sample, the peace officer has reason to believe that it is radioactive material, the maximum dose rate on contact is less than or equal to 2 mSv/h on any external surface of the container, there is no loss or dispersal of the material during the transport, and the Commission is advised immediately of the transport. |
| 2018-04-30 | Documentation of characterization The person who performs the characterization must keep a record documenting the detection of the radiation and the disposal of the nuclear substance for two years; file an annual report with the Commission by April 30 that contains a summary of radiation detections for the calendar year before the date of the report; and immediately notify the Commission if the source of the radioactivity in the load is determined to be a licensable quantity of a nuclear substance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
