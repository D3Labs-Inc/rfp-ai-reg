# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or the occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The approach surfaces, shown on Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 08-26 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 08, a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 26, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip, and 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
