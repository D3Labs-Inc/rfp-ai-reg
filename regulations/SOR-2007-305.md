# Summary
Primary producers without an export history If none of a primary producer’s products were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period and if the primary producer produced Quebec softwood lumber products during the period beginning on January 1, 2004 and ending on December 31, 2006 and they apply for an export allocation, the primary producer may only receive the allocation calculated using the method described in subsection 6(1) (which is based on their historic production volume).
Allocation to remanufacturers The allocation of the Quebec quantity to a remanufacturer that is based on their historic export volume is calculated in accordance with the formula QQ × (RE/TEQ) where QQ is the Quebec quantity; RE is the volume of the remanufacturer’s products that were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period; and TEQ is the total volume of the primary producers’ and remanufacturers’ products that were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period, excluding the volume of products of primary producers and remanufacturers who indicate in writing to the Minister before December 14, 2007 that they relinquish their allocation of the Quebec quantity for 2008.
