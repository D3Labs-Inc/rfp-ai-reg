# Summary
No payment out of the Investors’ Indemnity Account in respect of a claim submitted under subsection (1) shall be made until the claim has been investigated by an officer of the Department of Finance or such other person as the Minister of Finance may designate.
Where the Minister of Finance, after reviewing a claim submitted under subsection (1) accompanied by a statement of the relevant facts and a report of the investigation in respect of such claim required under subsection (2), decides that a payment is to be made in respect of the claim, the amount of the payment as determined by the Minister shall be paid to the claimant or his legal representatives or such other person as the Minister decides, but no payment in excess of $5,000 shall be made except with the prior approval of the Treasury Board.
Where a claim for payment out of the Investors’ Indemnity Account is made in respect of a loss suffered by a subscriber who has paid an amount on account of the purchase of a security to a person authorized to receive subscriptions for securities, or whose employer has, out of amounts payable to the subscriber, retained an amount to be used to purchase a security for the subscriber or his nominee, no payment shall be made out of the Investors’ Indemnity Account unless the subscriber or his legal representative executes an assignment in favour of Her Majesty of all his claims in respect of the amount so paid or retained and of the said security.
