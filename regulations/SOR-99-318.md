# Summary
Before taking a course of action under subsection 15(1), if the CPA is aware of any special circumstances of a project that would make the project of interest to the public or if public participation is required by any Act of Parliament or regulation made under it, the CPA shall give the public notice of the screening and an opportunity to examine and comment on the screening report and on any record that has been filed in the public registry established in respect of the project in accordance with section 31.
The Minister, after consulting with the Minister of Transport and the CPA, may at any time or on the request of the CPA under section 20, refer a project to a review panel in accordance with section 29 of the Act based on consideration, in addition to the factors referred to in paragraphs 20(a) and (b), of the following factors: the level and nature of public concern about the project; the extent to which the issues of public concern relate to potentially significant environmental effects and to matters under federal jurisdiction; any scientific or technical information relating to the project; the extent to which, and the manner in which, the project has undergone an environmental assessment, other government review or public review; and the likely ability of a review panel, if appointed, to complete its work and contribute to resolving issues of public concern.
