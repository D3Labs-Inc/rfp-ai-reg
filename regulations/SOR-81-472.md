# Summary
The approach surfaces, shown on Department of Transport Yellowknife Zoning Plan dated March 31, 1978, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 08-26 and 14-32 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 08, a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 26, a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 14, and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 32, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to 50 feet measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of each strip 1,000 feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of each strip and 50,000 feet measured horizontally from the end of each strip, the outer ends of each imaginary horizontal line being 8,000 feet from each projected centre line.
