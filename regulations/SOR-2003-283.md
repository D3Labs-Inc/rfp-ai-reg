# Summary
No person shall, in a given year, use a solvent set out in column 1 of Schedule 1 in a degreasing process set out in column 2 in a quantity that exceeds the threshold set out in column 3 on or after the date set out in column 4 unless, for each kilogram of solvent that exceeds the threshold, the person has a consumption unit issued by the Minister under subsection 4(1) or transferred under section 6.
Every person who has a consumption unit shall submit a report to the Minister containing the information specified in Schedule 6 on a form provided by the Minister, no later than 30 days after the end of the year to which the consumption unit applies; and keep a copy of the report and any documents, including shipping records, supporting the information provided to the Minister or showing quantities of solvent purchased, returned or transferred, or sent to a waste management facility, at the location where the solvent is being used, for a period of five years after the end of the year in respect of which the report is made.
