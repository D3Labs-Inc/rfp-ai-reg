# Summary
If, in a harbour, a person conducts an activity, other than an activity set out in the schedule, that is likely to have any of the results prohibited under section 3, a harbour official may instruct the person conducting the activity to cease the activity or authorize the person to conduct the activity on condition that the person takes measures reasonably necessary to mitigate or prevent the result.
Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a harbour official may, by such means as posted signs, nautical charts, maps or forms, give an authorization under this section to conduct, in a harbour, an activity set out in column 1 of the schedule if an “X” is set out in column 2.
If the conduct of the activity is likely to have a result prohibited under section 3, the harbour official may give the authorization for the activity only if the harbour official establishes conditions designed to mitigate or prevent the result; and communicates the conditions by posting them in a prominent place clearly visible to persons wanting to conduct the activity or setting them out on forms that are readily available to persons wanting to conduct the activity.
