# Summary
These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport that consist of the lands within, and the lands directly under that portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits described in Part II of the schedule.
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or the occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown outlined in yellow on Department of Transport Plan E.1539, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 30 feet above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 30 feet above the surface of the ground.
