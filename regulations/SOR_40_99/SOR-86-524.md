# Summary
The Minister may insure a loan made in respect of an Atlantic project in the tourism sector as described in item 11 of the schedule if the quality and scope of the Atlantic project are such that it would attract or provide services for tourists.
For the purpose of subsection (1),  loss  means the aggregate of the principal amount of a loan outstanding and the amount of unpaid interest at the date of the formal demand, less the net amount realized on the security provided for the loan, and the portion of any other amount recovered by the lender after the date of the formal demand in excess of all other indebtedness of the applicant to the lender; reasonable legal fees, disbursements and other expenses paid by the lender to collect or to endeavour to collect any amount referred to in paragraph (a) or any portion thereof; disbursements made by the lender to protect any security provided for the loan; and interest on the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) from the date of the formal demand until the date of payment of the lenderâ€™s claim by the Minister at the rate charged by the lender at the date of the formal demand, for a period of up to l80 days from the date of the formal demand, and for an additional period not exceeding 180 days where the Minister and the lender have agreed that it is in the interest of all parties concerned to wait for that additional period before realizing on the security or any portion thereof, and at one-half the rate referred to in subparagraph (i) for any period after the relevant period or periods referred to in that subparagraph.

# URL
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-86-524/FullText.html


# Summary
The Minister may insure a loan made in respect of an Atlantic project in the tourism sector as described in item 11 of the schedule if the quality and scope of the Atlantic project are such that it would attract or provide services for tourists.
For the purpose of subsection (1),  loss  means the aggregate of the principal amount of a loan outstanding and the amount of unpaid interest at the date of the formal demand, less the net amount realized on the security provided for the loan, and the portion of any other amount recovered by the lender after the date of the formal demand in excess of all other indebtedness of the applicant to the lender; reasonable legal fees, disbursements and other expenses paid by the lender to collect or to endeavour to collect any amount referred to in paragraph (a) or any portion thereof; disbursements made by the lender to protect any security provided for the loan; and interest on the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) from the date of the formal demand until the date of payment of the lenderâ€™s claim by the Minister at the rate charged by the lender at the date of the formal demand, for a period of up to l80 days from the date of the formal demand, and for an additional period not exceeding 180 days where the Minister and the lender have agreed that it is in the interest of all parties concerned to wait for that additional period before realizing on the security or any portion thereof, and at one-half the rate referred to in subparagraph (i) for any period after the relevant period or periods referred to in that subparagraph.
