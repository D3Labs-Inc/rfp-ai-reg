# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on Department of Public Works Plan No. E1455 dated June 21, 1978, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 30 feet above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 30 feet above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Public Works Plan No. E1455 dated June 21, 1978, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to seven feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surface to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
