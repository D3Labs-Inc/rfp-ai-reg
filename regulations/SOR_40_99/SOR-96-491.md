# Summary
Where at any time the Minister is of the opinion that a project for which an environmental assessment may be required under paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b), taking into account the implementation of any appropriate mitigation measures, may cause significant adverse environmental effects, or public concerns warrant a reference to a mediator, a review panel or an advisory committee, the Minister may, after offering to consult with the jurisdiction, within the meaning of paragraph 40(1)(e) or (f), where the project is to be carried out and after consulting with the responsible authority and the Minister of Foreign Affairs or, where there is no responsible authority in relation to the project, the appropriate federal authority, refer the project to a mediator, a review panel or an advisory committee in accordance with section 29.
An advisory committee shall, in accordance with its term of reference, ensure that the information required for an assessment by an advisory committee is obtained and made available to the public; offer the public an opportunity to participate in the assessment; prepare a report setting out the rationale, conclusions and recommendations of the committee relating to the environmental assessment of the project, including any mitigation measures and follow-up program, and a summary of any comments received from the interested parties; and submit the report to the Minister, the responsible authority and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
