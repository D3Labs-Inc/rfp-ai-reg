abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 11 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence such approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to the said outer surface to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 600 m from the projected centre line; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 29 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an intersection with the outer surface,

| 1983-04-12 | 1594, sheets 1 to 13 inclusive, dated April 12, 1983, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, an imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
