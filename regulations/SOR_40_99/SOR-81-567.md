# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on Transport Canada Fort Smith Zoning Plan dated August 30, 1978, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45.7 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9.1 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located 9.1 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Transport Canada Fort Smith Zoning Plan dated August 30, 1978, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
