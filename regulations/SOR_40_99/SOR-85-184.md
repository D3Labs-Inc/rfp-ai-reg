# Summary
The approach surfaces, shown on Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1756 dated September 9, 1983, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 13-31 and are described as inclined planes having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to imaginary horizontal lines drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the ends of the strip and 15 000 m measured horizontally from the ends of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal lines being 2 400 m from the projected centre line.
The transitional surfaces, shown on Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1756 dated September 9, 1983, are surfaces consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
