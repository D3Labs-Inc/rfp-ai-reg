# Summary
Each pilot described in subsection (1) shall be deemed to have to his credit as pensionable service under the Act as of October 1st, 1966 the whole or that portion of the active service to his credit under the By-law that his accumulated contributions will purchase when applied to that part of his service under the By-law that is most recent in point of time, calculated by the Minister in accordance with twice the rate or rates of contributions applying from time to time under the Act in respect of a corresponding period of service in the Public Service, as if the pilot were a contributor under the Act during that period of service; the salary payable to the pilot in respect of that service were equal to the moneys that were actually paid to him for service as a pilot during that period; and interest had been paid on those contributions at a rate equal to the rate at which, in the opinion of the Minister, interest in respect of contributions under the Act was payable under the Act during that period of service, calculated from the middle of each fiscal year in that period of service to October 1st, 1966.
