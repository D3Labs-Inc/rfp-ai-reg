# Summary
Subject to subsection (2), these Regulations apply to persons who, on the transfer date, cease to be employed in the public service and become employed by NAV CANADA as a result of the NAV CANADA divestiture.
When a person exercises an option under subsection (2), for the purposes of section 13.01 of the Act and sections 83 to 99 of the  Public Service Superannuation Regulations ,  valuation day  means the date on which the person exercises an option for a transfer value.
Adaptation of Sections 12 and 13 of the Act. For the purposes of sections 12 and 13 of the Act, pensionable service includes the period of service with NAV CANADA that begins on the transfer date and that ends on the date on which the person ceases to be employed by NAV CANADA.
Adaptation of Sections 16 and 17 of the Act. For the purposes of section 17 of the Act, ceasing otherwise than voluntarily to be employed in operational service has the same meaning as in the NAV CANADA pension plan; but does not include ceasing to be employed in the public service as a result of the NAV CANADA divestiture.
