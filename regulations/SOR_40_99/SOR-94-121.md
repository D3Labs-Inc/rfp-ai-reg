# Summary
Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on St. Anthony Airport Zoning Plan No. S-2211-2, dated March 30, 1990, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on St. Anthony Airport Zoning Plan No. S-2211-2, dated March 30, 1990, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The outer limit, shown on St. Anthony Airport Zoning Plan No. S-2211-2, dated March 30, 1990, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
