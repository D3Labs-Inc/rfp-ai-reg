# Summary
Subject to subsection (2) and section 7, an association shall ensure that every security is kept securely, in a manner that prevents unauthorized access to the security, in the custody of the association; or an entity that is authorized to act as a custodian of securities or as a depository or clearing agency for securities by a law of the jurisdiction in which the entity is carrying on business.
An association shall acquire and at all times maintain one or more bonds issued by an entity authorized to insure risks under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the entity carries on business to indemnify the association for any loss in respect of assets owned or held by that association arising out of a dishonest or criminal act of an officer or employee of that association.
A bond or an insurance policy acquired and maintained in accordance with section 10 shall be in an amount that is established by the directors of the association, having regard to the nature and value of the assets owned or held by the association; the arrangements and procedures applicable to the handling and safeguarding of the assets owned or held by the association; and any other factors that might affect the extent of any loss that the association might sustain.
