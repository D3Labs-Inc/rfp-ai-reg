# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point, shown on Toronto/Buttonville Airport Zoning Plan No. 19-036-84-05, sheet 5, dated May 30, 1986, is a point distant 45.0 m measured northeasterly at right angles to the centre line of runway 15-33 from a point distant 485.0 m measured southeasterly along the said centre line from the northwesterly end of the said runway.
Each transitional surface shown on Toronto/Buttonville Airport Zoning Plan No. 19-036-84-05, Sheets 2, 5, 6 and 8, dated May 30, 1986 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and the projected centre line of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

associated with runways designated 03-21 and 15-33 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 03 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 446 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 174.6 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 48.2 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 15 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 724 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 333.6 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 43.1 m above the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 21 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 203 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 150.3 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 40.1 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 33 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 768 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 340.2 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 44.2 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.
