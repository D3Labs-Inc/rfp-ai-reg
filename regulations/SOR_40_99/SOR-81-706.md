# Summary
The outer surface, shown on Department of Transport Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1544, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The strips, shown on Department of Transport Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1544, are described as follows: the strip associated with runway 12-30 is 300 m in width, 150 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 948.8 m in length; and the strip associated with runway 17-35 is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 644 m in length.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Transport Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1544, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
