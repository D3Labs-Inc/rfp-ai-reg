# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on Moosonee Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090 85-59, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated June 30, 1987, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Moosonee Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090 85-59, Sheets 1 to 8 inclusive, dated June 30, 1987, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1987-06-30 | The outer surface, shown on Moosonee Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090 85-59, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated June 30, 1987, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 2018-01-08 | Each transitional surface, shown on Moosonee Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090 85-59, Sheets 1 to 8 inclusive, dated June 30, 1987, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
