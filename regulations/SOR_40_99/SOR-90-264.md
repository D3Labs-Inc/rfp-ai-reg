# Summary
Item Required Information 1 General arrangement and location of permanently installed fuel oil systems including connections to boilers, engines, heat exchangers, incinerators, cooking ranges, cabin hot-air heaters, pumps, purifiers, filters, valves, pressure gauges, piping, filling stations, tanks, tank sounding devices, flame-screened venting and overflow arrangements, drip trays and sludge facilities and oil pollution prevention components.
Item Requirements 1 Where applicable and, in the opinion of the inspector, practicable, inspection of securing arrangements and of locations where fluid leakage or excessive vibration may occur, particularly from any heated oil piping and flexible hoses; verification that pumps, heat exchangers, appliances, control, monitoring and alarm systems, tank sounding and venting devices and all oil pollution control devices are in correct adjustment and operational condition; verification that documentation is held aboard the ship indicating the closed cup test flash point of the ship’s fuel oil; and verification that a 0.25 L minimum sample of the fuel oil that is carried and used on board the ship is held aboard ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and over until the fuel oil is completely used.
