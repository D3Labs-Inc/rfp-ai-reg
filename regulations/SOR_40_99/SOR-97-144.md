# Summary
( franchise ) fee revenue , in respect of a licensee of a broadcasting undertaking, means the gross revenue derived during a return year from the licensed activity of the licensee, whether received by the licensee or by an associated corporation, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes any revenue received in respect of all transmitters forming part of the undertaking, where the broadcasting undertaking consists of more than one transmitter; the estimated annual revenue, based on the trends of the market in which the undertaking is licensed to operate, the previous financial performance of the undertaking, and, where applicable, the licensee’s business plan for the first 12 months of operations, where the licensee has not filed a licence fee return covering 12 months of the most recently completed return year; and revenue that is derived from the sale of air time of the broadcasting undertaking by the Corporation and paid by the Corporation to the licensee.
The initial amount shall be calculated by the Commission using the formula (A / B) × C  where A is the licensee’s fee revenues for the most recently completed return year, less that licensee’s exemption level for that return year; B is the aggregate fee revenues for the most recently completed return year of all licensees whose fee revenues exceed the applicable exemption levels, less the aggregate exemption level for all those licensees for that return year; and C is the estimated total regulatory costs of the Commission for the current fiscal year as calculated in accordance with section 9.
