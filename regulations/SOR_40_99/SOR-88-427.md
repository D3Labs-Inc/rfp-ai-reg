# Summary
Without restricting the generality of Rule 3 or 4, the judge who presides at a pre-hearing conference may inquire into and discuss the extent of disclosure made by the Crown and any further requests therefor by an accused or counsel for an accused; the possibility of resolution of any or all of the issues in the proceeding, including the possible disposition of any or all counts contained in the indictment, whether by plea of guilty or otherwise; the simplification of such issues as remain to be litigated at trial; the possibility of obtaining admissions and agreements so as to facilitate a fair, just and expeditious determination of the proceedings; the estimated duration of the trial; the advisability of fixing a date for trial where one is not already fixed; and any other matter that may assist in promoting a fair, just, and expeditious trial including the holding of further pre-hearing conferences.
Nothing in these Rules shall be construed or interpreted so as to preclude a judge from conducting, with the consent of counsel for the Crown and counsel for the accused, or, in the case of an accused who is not represented by counsel, the accused, such other informal pre-hearing conferences, in addition to the conference provided for in subsection 553.1(2) of the  Criminal Code , on such terms as the judge considers fit.
