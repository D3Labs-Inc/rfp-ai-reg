| 2011-09-10 | The approach surfaces, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16, dated 4 December 1990, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 07-25, and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 07 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 25 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant l5 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 1990-12-04 | The approach surfaces, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16, dated 4 December 1990, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 07-25, and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 07 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 25 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant l5 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-07-25 | The approach surfaces, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16, dated 4 December 1990, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 07-25, and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 07 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 25 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant l5 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2012-10-11 | The outer surface, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, dated 4 December 1990, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1990-12-04 | The outer surface, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, dated 4 December 1990, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 2018-09-10 | Each transitional surface, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 9, 10 and 11, dated 4 December 1990, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of l m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.

| 1990-12-04 | Each transitional surface, shown on Kenora Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-014 89-021, Sheets 9, 10 and 11, dated 4 December 1990, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of l m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
