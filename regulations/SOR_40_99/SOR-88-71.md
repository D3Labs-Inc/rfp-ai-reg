machinery and equipment that was manufactured outside Canada that is attributable to the cost of installing that machinery and equipment minus the part of the costs referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) that was incurred in respect of machinery and equipment disposed of before the beginning of the period.

that class in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19 ; the ratio of the net sales value of the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada by the company to the total net sales value of all vehicles of that class to be sold for consumption in Canada by the company during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will be equal to or higher than the ratio achieved by the company in the base year; and the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will have a Canadian value added that is equal to or greater than the Canadian value added in respect of all vehicles of that class that were produced by the company in Canada during the base year.

| 2019-07-31 | I further declare that the company produced vehicles of that class in Canada during each of the four consecutive quarters of the base year; the company intends to produce vehicles of that class in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19 ; the ratio of the net sales value of the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada by the company to the total net sales value of all vehicles of that class to be sold for consumption in Canada by the company during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will be equal to or higher than the ratio achieved by the company in the base year; and the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will have a Canadian value added that is equal to or greater than the Canadian value added in respect of all vehicles of that class that were produced by the company in Canada during the base year.

| 2019-08-01 | I further declare that the company produced vehicles of that class in Canada during each of the four consecutive quarters of the base year; the company intends to produce vehicles of that class in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19 ; the ratio of the net sales value of the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada by the company to the total net sales value of all vehicles of that class to be sold for consumption in Canada by the company during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will be equal to or higher than the ratio achieved by the company in the base year; and the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will have a Canadian value added that is equal to or greater than the Canadian value added in respect of all vehicles of that class that were produced by the company in Canada during the base year.

| 2019-07-31 | I further declare that the company produced vehicles of that class in Canada during each of the four consecutive quarters of the base year; the company intends to produce vehicles of that class in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19 ; the ratio of the net sales value of the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada by the company to the total net sales value of all vehicles of that class to be sold for consumption in Canada by the company during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will be equal to or higher than the ratio achieved by the company in the base year; and the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will have a Canadian value added that is equal to or greater than the Canadian value added in respect of all vehicles of that class that were produced by the company in Canada during the base year.

that class in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19 ; the ratio of the net sales value of the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada by the company to the total net sales value of all vehicles of that class to be sold for consumption in Canada by the company during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will be equal to or higher than the ratio achieved by the company in the base year; and the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will have a Canadian value added that is equal to or greater than the Canadian value added in respect of all vehicles of that class that were produced by the company in Canada during the base year.

| 2019-07-31 | I further declare that the company produced vehicles of that class in Canada during each of the four consecutive quarters of the base year; the company intends to produce vehicles of that class in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19 ; the ratio of the net sales value of the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada by the company to the total net sales value of all vehicles of that class to be sold for consumption in Canada by the company during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will be equal to or higher than the ratio achieved by the company in the base year; and the vehicles of that class that are to be produced in Canada during the period August 1, 19  to July 31, 19  will have a Canadian value added that is equal to or greater than the Canadian value added in respect of all vehicles of that class that were produced by the company in Canada during the base year.
