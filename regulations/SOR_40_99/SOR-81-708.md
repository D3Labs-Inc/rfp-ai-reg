The outer surface, shown on Department of Transport Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1540, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 30 feet above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located 30 feet above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Transport Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1540, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to seven feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line, and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
