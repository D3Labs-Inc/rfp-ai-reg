# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3039, dated October 18, 1994, is a point located on the centre line of runway 084T-264T at a distance of 609.6 m from the threshold of runway 084T.
The approach surfaces, shown on Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3039, dated October 18, 1994, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 084T-264T and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 084T having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 264T having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3039, dated October 18, 1994, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
