# Summary
A lender shall, at the time of making a disbursement on a loan of a prescribed class, require that the borrower sign a promissory note that sets out the principal amount of the disbursement, the rate of interest payable on the loan and the repayment terms.
Where the lender and the borrower agree to revise the repayment terms of a loan of a prescribed class by extending the time of the repayment beyond the period provided for in paragraph 3(2)(e) of the Act, it is a condition of the Minister’s liability under the Act that the approval of the Minister shall be obtained in writing prior to the extension.
Where the Minister is unable to register a loan of a prescribed class because the lender has inadvertently failed to request registration within the period set out in subsection (1), or to pay the fee required by paragraph 3(4)(b) of the Act, the Minister may, if the borrower is not in default, extend the period for registration to a day not more than one year after the day on which the initial disbursement was advanced.
