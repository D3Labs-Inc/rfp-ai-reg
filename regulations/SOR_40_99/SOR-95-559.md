# Summary
Where an object of natural growth that is on land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister of Transport may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excess growth.
The airport reference point, shown on Fort Liard Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3047, dated March 30, l995, is a point located on the centre line of runway 02-20 at a distance of 457.2 m from the threshold of runway 02.
Each transitional surface, shown on Fort Liard Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3047, dated March 30, l995, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Fort Liard Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3047, dated March 30, l995, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
