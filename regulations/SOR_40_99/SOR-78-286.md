# Summary
1978-952 His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the President of the Treasury Board, pursuant to the Department of Transport Vote 52d of  Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977 , is pleased hereby to make the annexed  Regulations respecting a Contract between the Minister and Via Rail Canada Inc. with respect to Railway Passenger Services .
Payments to Via. Every railway passenger service contract shall provide, with respect to payments to VIA pursuant to the contract or a subsidiary service request, undertakings whereby any payment by the Minister may include provision for financial incentive measures; the application of financial incentive measures will be undertaken so as to encourage cost-effective decision-making by VIA in making the trade-off between attracting passengers and reducing costs, and vary the terms of payment from route to route as may be required in accordance with the competitive conditions and government objectives on each route; payments will not be based on the actual costs incurred by VIA of providing, managing or operating the service but will be determined at the time of the contract or request, as the case may be, on the basis of estimated costs less estimated revenues, having regard to the minimum level and quality of service and the pricing conditions prescribed by the Minister; and in determining payments the estimate of costs related to the operation of passenger services will not exceed, without approval of the Minister, costs determined by the application of CTC Order R-6313, subject to indexing supplied by the Canadian Transport Commission.
