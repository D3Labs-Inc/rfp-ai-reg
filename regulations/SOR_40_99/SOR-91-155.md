# Summary
The concentration of particulate matter that the owner or operator of a secondary lead smelter releases into the ambient air shall not exceed 0.046 grams per normal cubic metre, in the case of operations involving the use of blast furnaces, cupolas or reverberatory furnaces, and 0.023 grams per normal cubic metre, in the case of operations involving the use of holding furnaces, kettle furnaces or lead oxide production units or involving scrap handling and material handling, crushing, furnace tapping, furnace slagging, furnace cleaning or casting, whether released separately or in combination with releases from other sources, measured dry and undiluted in accordance with the method described in  Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Particulate Matter and Lead from Secondary Lead Smelters , Department of the Environment Report EPS-1-AP-78-3 dated June 1979, as amended from time to time.
Where, pursuant to section 8, the Minister requests information respecting a malfunction or breakdown in the air pollution control equipment or the process equipment associated with the operations referred to in section 3, the owner or operator of the secondary lead smelter shall submit to the Minister a duly completed Malfunction or Breakdown Report in the form set out in Schedule II on a monthly basis commencing two months after the request is made by the Minister.
