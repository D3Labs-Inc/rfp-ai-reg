# Summary
The airport reference point shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-3 to S-1857-6 inclusive, dated February 12, 1988, is determined by measuring l 200 m northerly along the centre line of runway 03-21 from the southerly end of runway 03 and thence measuring easterly at right angles from the said centre line, 300 m from the centre line of said runway.
Each transitional surface, shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0 and S-1857-3 to S-1857-6 inclusive, dated February 12, 1988, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
The boundary of the outer limits, shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0, S-1857-2 to S-1857-6 inclusive, S-1857-8, S-1857-9 and S-1857-11 dated February 12, l988, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
