# Summary
This By-law applies to deposits referred to in subsection 14(2.51) of the Act. Prescribed Indexes and Reference Points.
Subject to sections 5 to 7, the interest accruing and payable in relation to a deposit shall be determined, as of the interest termination date, in accordance with the provisions of the deposit contract between the depositor and the member institution.
Interest shall not be determined in accordance with subsection (1) where the deposit contract provides for the payment of a minimum amount of interest that exceeds the amount which would be payable under that subsection, or where it provides for the payment of a maximum amount of interest that is less than the amount which would be payable under that subsection.
In determining the interest accruing and payable in relation to a deposit, no account shall be taken of any provision of the deposit contract that provides, whether by way of penalty or otherwise, for a reduction in the amount of interest payable in the case of early withdrawal.
