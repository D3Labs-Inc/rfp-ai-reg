A society shall acquire and maintain one or more bonds, issued by an entity authorized to insure risks under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the entity carries on business, to indemnify the society for any loss in respect of assets owned or held by the society that arises out of a dishonest or criminal act of an officer or employee of the society.
