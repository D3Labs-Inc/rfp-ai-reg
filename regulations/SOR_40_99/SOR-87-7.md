# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2 and S-1448-6, dated December 31, 1984, is determined by measuring 975.36 m southeasterly along the centre line and centre line produced of runway 01-19 from the northerly end of the strip and thence measuring southwesterly at right angles 152.40 m from the centre line of the said runway 01-19.
The outer surface, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2, S-1448-4, S-1448-5, S-1448-6, S-1448-7, S-1448-8, S-1448-9, S-1448-10 and S-1448-11, dated December 31, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, in which case the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2, S-1448-4, S-1448-5, S-1448-6 and S-1448-7, dated December 31, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
