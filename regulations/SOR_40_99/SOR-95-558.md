# Summary
The reference point has Nova Scotia Grid Co-ordinates with a Northing of 4 982 711.68 m and an Easting of 5 465 850.41 m and is shown on Public Works Canada Greenwood Airport Zoning Plan No. S-1750, dated November 15, 1988.
Each transitional surface, shown on Public Works Canada Greenwood Airport Zoning Plan No. S-1750, dated November 15, 1988, is an inclined plane that rises at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line of a strip and that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or the transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
The outer surface, shown on Public Works Canada Greenwood Airport Zoning Plan No. S-1750, dated November 15, 1988, is an imaginary surface that consists of a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport zoning reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The outer limits are shown on Public Works Canada Greenwood Airport Zoning Plan No. S-1750, dated November 15, 1988.
The outer limits are shown on Public Works Canada Greenwood Airport Zoning Plan No. S-1750, dated November 15, 1988.
