# Summary
Subject to subsections (6) and (7), a contributor who, before or after the coming into force of this subsection, was absent from duty in the naval, army or air forces of Canada for any purpose, including absence on leave without pay and allowances or secondment without pay and allowances, shall, whether or not he was a contributor at the time of such absence, contribute, in respect of such period of absence by making payments in accordance with subsection (2), and such period of absence shall be counted as service for the purposes of computing a pension or gratuity.
Where a contributor prior to the war which commenced on the 10th day of September, 1939, served as an officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force other than the Permanent Active Air Force, for a continuous period of full-time service, but did not receive the pay of his rank as though he were in the forces, and subsequently served on active service during that war and during such period of full-time service received remuneration by way of pay, or pay and allowances, according to the service regulations applicable to his appointment, then in that case, such continuous period of full-time service may be included for the purpose of making contributions and computing a pension or gratuity to which he may be entitled under Part V.

| 1 day        | Where the amount of the arrears of contributions, as verified by the service authorities, is greater than the amount set out in the provisional computation submitted by the contributor, the contributor may elect, but only once, to pay the unpaid portion of the verified arrears if he has originally elected to pay the arrears in one sum, then either in one sum or in instalments equivalent in value to the total amount of arrears; or if he has originally elected to pay the arrears by instalments, then by instalments equivalent in value to the total amount of the arrears, over a longer period, provided that he has made his further election prior to acknowledging as correct the amount of the arrears, as verified by the service authorities, or he has, prior to the first day of September, 1950, acknowledged as correct the amount of the arrears, as verified by the service authorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1 year       | The amount of contributions required of a contributor in respect of service for which he elects under subsection (2a) of section 48 of the Act is as follows: if he was a contributor immediately prior to the coming into force of this subsection, having served continuously in the forces from that date to the date of election, and the election is made within one year of the coming into force of this subsection; or if he was a former contributor prior to the coming into force of this subsection to whom paragraph (a) did not apply and the election is made within one year of his first becoming a contributor subsequent to the coming into force of this subsection; the amount required is an amount equal to the amount he would be required to contribute had he elected under subsection (1) of section 48 of the Act, and if he is not a contributor as described in paragraph (a) or (b) the amount required is an amount equal to that which he would have been required to contribute had he elected under subsection (1) of section 48 of the Act, but computed on his current rate of pay together with allowances set out in section 3 applicable to his rank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 35 year      | Where a pension or annual allowance (referred to herein as “the allowance” becomes payable to a widow under the Act, the  Public Service Superannuation Act , or the  Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act  (except Part IV), and a direction is made by the Minister pursuant to subsection (2) in respect of such widow, that part only of the discontinued pension shall be resumed which is the greater of an amount which, when added to the annual amount of the allowance equals the annual amount of the discontinued pension, or an amount determined by a fraction of the annual amount of the discontinued pension the numerator of which is that number of years of service upon which the discontinued pension is based which, when added to number of years of service or pensionable services upon which the allowance is based, does not exceed in the aggregate thirty-five years, and the denominator of which is the number of years of service upon which the discontinued pension is based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
