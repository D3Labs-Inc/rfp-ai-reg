# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a), (b) and (c), the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on St. Catharines Airport Zoning Plan No. 26-047-81-67, Sheets 1 to 9, dated March 30, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on St. Catharines Airport Zoning Plan No. 26-047-81-67, Sheets 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9, dated March 30, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
