# Summary
Notwithstanding subsection (4) and section 2603, where an individual resided in a particular province on the last day of a taxation year and had income for the year from a business with a permanent establishment in any other province, his income earned in the taxation year in the province is the amount, if any, by which his income for the year exceeds the aggregate of his income for the year from carrying on business earned in each other province, determined as hereinafter set forth in this Part.”, paragraph 126(7)(a) of the Act read as follows: business-income tax  paid by a taxpayer for a taxation year in respect of businesses carried on by him in a country other than Canada (in this paragraph referred to as the “business Country”) means such portion of 55/100ths of any income or profits tax paid by him for the year to the government of any country other than Canada or to the government of a state, province or other political subdivision of any such country as may reasonably be regarded as tax in respect of the income of the taxpayer from any business carried on by him in the business country;”, and paragraph 126(7)(d) of the Act read as follows: tax for the year otherwise payable under this Part  means the tax for the taxation year otherwise payable under this Part after taking into account the requirements of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(i) of the  Income Earned in Quebec Income Tax Remission Order, 1982 , but before making any deduction under sections 121, 126 and 127.” In subsection (1), a reference to the “last day of a taxation year” shall, in the case of an individual who resided in the Province of Quebec at any time in the year and ceased to reside in Canada before the end of the year, be deemed to be a reference to the last day in the year in which he resided in Canada.
