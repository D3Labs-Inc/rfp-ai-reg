# Summary
The airport reference point shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 149-329 distant 579.0 m from the threshold of runway 149.
The outer surface, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
