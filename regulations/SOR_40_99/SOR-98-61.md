The person returning to Canada may make an oral report in respect of the goods referred to in subsection (1) if the goods are in the actual possession of the person, or form part of the person’s baggage carried on board the same conveyance as the person, and the person is returning to Canada on board a non-commercial passenger conveyance or a bus; or the person is returning to Canada on board a highway conveyance at a land border crossing at a designated customs office and is authorized under the  Presentation of Persons (2003) Regulations  to present themself in an alternate manner under subparagraph 11(d)(ii) of those Regulations.
