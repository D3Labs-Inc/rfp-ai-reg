# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 5 (a) to (c), the Minister may direct the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing to remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on Hamilton Airport Zoning Plan No. 25-009-81-120, sheets 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11 and 12, dated June 21, 1983 is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, an imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Hamilton Airport Zoning Plan No. 25-009-81-120, sheets 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11 and 12, dated June 21, 1983, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1983-06-21 | The outer surface, shown on Hamilton Airport Zoning Plan No. 25-009-81-120, sheets 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11 and 12, dated June 21, 1983 is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, an imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1983-06-21 | Each transitional surface, shown on Hamilton Airport Zoning Plan No. 25-009-81-120, sheets 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11 and 12, dated June 21, 1983, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
