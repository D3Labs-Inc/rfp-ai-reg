# Summary
A tribunal shall, when directed to do so by the authority who established the tribunal, hold a hearing to determine whether a detainee brought before it is entitled to prisoner-of-war status.
Where a commanding officer believes that there may be doubt whether a detainee is entitled to prisoner-of-war status, the commanding officer shall request, as soon as is practicable, an authority referred to in section 3 to direct that a tribunal hold a hearing to determine the detainee’s entitlement to that status.
An authority who directs a tribunal to hold a hearing to determine a detainee’s entitlement to prisoner-of-war status shall appoint an officer or a non-commissioned member to act as investigating member for the tribunal.
The minutes of proceedings shall contain a copy of the direction to determine the status of the detainee; a record of the time and place of the hearing and the names of the persons present; a summary of the testimony of all witnesses heard by the tribunal; all real and documentary evidence considered by the tribunal; and a record of the tribunal’s determination and the reasons therefor and the time and date when the determination was announced.
