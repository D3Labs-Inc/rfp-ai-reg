| 2006-04-05 | The approach surfaces, as shown on Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131, Sheets 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12 and 13, dated August 21, 1986, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 17-35 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 17 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 35 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 1986-08-21 | The approach surfaces, as shown on Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131, Sheets 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12 and 13, dated August 21, 1986, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 17-35 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 17 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 35 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-01-09 | The outer surface, as shown on Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, 11 and 12, dated August 21, 1986, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1986-08-21 | The outer surface, as shown on Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, 11 and 12, dated August 21, 1986, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 2006-04-05 | The transitional surface associated with runway 17-35, as shown on Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131, Sheets 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12, dated August 21, 1986, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of a 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.

| 1986-08-21 | The transitional surface associated with runway 17-35, as shown on Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131, Sheets 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12, dated August 21, 1986, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of a 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
