# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which the object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point, shown on Toronto Island Airport Zoning Plan No. 20-004-83-113, Sheet 3, dated October 26, 1984, is a point distant 35 m measured northerly at right angles to the centre line of runway 08-26 from a point distant 610 m measured easterly along the said centre line from the westerly end of said runway.
Each transitional surface, shown on Toronto Island Airport Zoning Plan No. 20-004-83-113, Sheets 2, 3, and 4, dated October 26, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and the centre line produced of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
