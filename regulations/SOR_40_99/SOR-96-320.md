For the purposes of the determinations referred to in sections 9 and 10, the rates of interest set out in the  Recommendations for the Computation of Transfer Values from Registered Pension Plans , published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, effective September 1, 1993, shall be the rates of interest in respect of subject to paragraph (b), fully indexed pensions; and unindexed pensions for the period in respect of which no supplementary benefits would be payable under Part IV of the Act, in the case of a former member who has not yet reached 60 years of age.
In the case of a former member described in subsection 10(2), the adjustment of the amount of the former member’s joint and survivor benefit is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which their retiring or compensation allowances or supplementary benefits, as the case may be, would become payable.

| 5 year     | Where a birth certificate cannot be obtained, proof of age of a spouse is established by a statutory declaration of the spouse in which the spouse attests to their date of birth and explains the reasons why the birth certificate cannot be obtained; and a document that was created within five years after the spouse’s date of birth, that states the name of the spouse and their date of birth or age, or at least 20 years before the day on which the election is made, that states the spouse’s date of birth, accompanied by a statutory declaration by which a person other than the former member or the spouse attests that the date stated in the document is the correct date of birth of the spouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
