# Summary
Where an employer relies on a system in assessing the value of work performed by employees employed in the same establishment, that system shall be used in the investigation of any complaint alleging a difference in wages, if that system operates without any sexual bias; is capable of measuring the relative value of work of all jobs in the establishment; and assesses the skill, effort and responsibility and the working conditions determined in accordance with sections 3 to 8.
In addition to the requirement of section 17, for the purpose of justifying a difference in wages on the basis of paragraph 16(h), an employer is required to establish that similar differences exist between the group of employees in the job classification affected by the shortage and another group of employees predominantly of the same sex as the group affected by the shortage, who are performing work of equal value.
Powers of Board The Board has, in relation to a complaint referred to it, in addition to the powers conferred on it under the  Public Service Labour Relations Act , the power to interpret and apply sections 7, 10 and 11 of the  Canadian Human Rights Act , and the  Equal Wages Guidelines, 1986 , in respect of employees, even after the coming into force of section  399 .
