# Summary
Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated September 28, 1988, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 4, 5 and 6, dated September 28, 1988, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.

| 1988-09-28 | The approach surfaces, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 4, 5 and 6, dated September 28, 1988, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway designated 08-26 and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 08 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 792 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 343.8 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 44.8 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 26 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 536 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 305.4 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 38.4 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-08-26 | The approach surfaces, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 4, 5 and 6, dated September 28, 1988, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway designated 08-26 and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 08 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 792 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 343.8 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 44.8 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 26 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 1 536 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 305.4 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 38.4 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-01-09 | The outer surface, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated September 28, 1988, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1988-09-28 | The outer surface, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 1 to 9 inclusive, dated September 28, 1988, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1988-09-28 | Each transitional surface, shown on Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112, Sheets 4, 5 and 6, dated September 28, 1988, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach
