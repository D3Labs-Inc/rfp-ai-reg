| 1979-03-01 | In this Order, auto-transformer  means a transformer in which part of one winding is common to both the primary and secondary circuits associated with that winding pursuant to section 4.25 of the Standard; ( autotransformateur ) base megavolt amperes  or  MVA  means the sum of the ONAN ratings, or the equivalent ONAN ratings of all windings, divided by two; ( puissance de base en mégavolts ampères ou MVA ) equivalent ONAN ratings  means the equivalent ONAN ratings as defined in section 4.16 of the Standard; ( valeurs ONAN équivalentes ) Standard  means the National Standard of Canada CAN3-C88-M79  “Power Transformers and Reactors” , published in March 1979 by the Canadian Standards Association; ( Norme ) voltage classification  means the level of power frequency voltage selected by the purchaser as a basis on which to identify the system of insulation levels and associated tests applicable to the transformer in accordance with section 4.26 of the Standard and that is used to identify the class of transformers set out in the dielectric tests listed in Tables 4 and 5 of the Standard.
