Each transitional surface, shown on Kingston Airport Zoning Plan No. 10-009-84-89, Sheets 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, dated February 14th, 1985, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2018-08-18 | The outer surface, shown on Kingston Airport Zoning Plan No. 10-009-84-89, Sheets 8 to 18, dated February 14th, 1985, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1985-02-14 | The outer surface, shown on Kingston Airport Zoning Plan No. 10-009-84-89, Sheets 8 to 18, dated February 14th, 1985, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1985-02-14 | Each transitional surface, shown on Kingston Airport Zoning Plan No. 10-009-84-89, Sheets 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, dated February 14th, 1985, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
