Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point, shown on Gillam Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2854, dated November 8, 1990, is a point located on the centre line of runway 05-23 distant 762 m from the threshold of runway 05.
The outer surface, shown on Gillam Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2854, dated November 8, 1990, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Gillam Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2854, dated November 8, 1990, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
