# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point shown on Weyburn Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2702 dated November 14, 1988, is a point located on the centre line of runway 12-30 distant 609.5 m from the threshold of runway 12.
The outer surface, shown on Weyburn Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2702 dated November 14, 1988, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Weyburn Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2702 dated November 14, 1988, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
