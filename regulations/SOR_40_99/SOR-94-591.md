# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Teslin Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3012, dated August 25, 1993, is a point located on the centre line of runway 08-26 distant 838.2 m from the threshold of runway 26.
The outer surface, shown on Teslin Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3012, dated August 25, 1993, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The strip associated with runway 08-26, shown on Teslin Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3012, dated August 25, 1993, is 90 m in width, 45 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 796.4 m in length.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Teslin Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3012, dated August 25, 1993, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
