| 1986-01-21 | The outer surface, shown on Prince Albert Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1939 dated January 21, 1986 is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of

| 1986-01-21 | The transitional surfaces, shown on Prince Albert Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1939 dated January 21, 1986, are described as follows: the transitional surface associated with runway 08-26 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and the transitional surface associated with runway 16-34 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
