# Summary
Measurements shall be taken of the amount of mercury released into the ambient air per day from sources specified in subsection (1) by taking the arithmetical average of not less than three measurements conducted for each source in the same day in accordance with the appropriate method, or any other method the results of which can be confirmed by the appropriate method, described in  Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Mercury from Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Plants , Department of the Environment Report EPS 1-AP-76-1 dated November 1976, as amended from time to time.
Where, pursuant to section 4, the Minister requests information respecting a malfunction or breakdown in the air pollution control equipment or the process equipment, the owner or operator of the plant shall, commencing two months after the request is made by the Minister, submit to the Minister, for any month in which a malfunction or breakdown occurs, the information required by the Malfunction or Breakdown Report set out in Schedule II.
