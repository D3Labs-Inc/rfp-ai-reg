# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The outer surface, shown outlined in yellow on the Department of Transport Plan No. B.C. 1266, dated January 14, 1980, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 metres above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than nine metres above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at nine metres above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on the Department of Transport Plan No. B.C. 1266, dated January 14, 1980, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to seven metres horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip and extending upward and outward rising from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1980-01-14 | 1266, dated January 14, 1980, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 07-25, 07R-25L and 12-30 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 07 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 50 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an intersection with the western extremity of said outer surface, thence said approach surface shall slope upward at the above specified slope of one metre measured vertically to 50 metres measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 metres measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 metres from the projected centre line, said imaginary horizontal line being 290.6 metres, measured vertically, above the airport reference point; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 25 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 50 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an intersection with the eastern extremity of said outer surface, thence said approach surface shall slope upward at the above specified slope of one metre measured vertically to 50 metres measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 metres measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 metres from the projected centre line, said imaginary horizontal line being 280.8 metres, measured vertically, above the airport reference point; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 07R consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 40 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 metres measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 375 metres from the projected centre line, said imaginary horizontal line being 45 metres, measured vertically, above the airport reference point; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 25L consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 40 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 metres measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 375 metres from the projected centre line, said imaginary horizontal line being 45 metres, measured vertically, above the airport reference point; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 12 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 40 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 metres measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 375 metres from the projected centre line, said imaginary horizontal line being 45 metres, measured vertically, above the airport reference point; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 40 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre

abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 07 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to 50 metres measured horizontally, rising to an intersection with the outer surface, thence said approach surface shall be horizontal and contiguous to said outer surface to an intersection with the western extremity of said outer surface, thence said approach surface shall slope upward at the above specified slope of one metre measured vertically to 50 metres measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles

| 1980-01-14 | 1266, dated January 14, 1980, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one metre measured vertically to seven metres horizontally at right angles to the centre
