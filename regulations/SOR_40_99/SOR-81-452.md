# Summary
In these Regulations, airport  means the Fredericton Airport, in the county of Sunbury, in the Province of New Brunswick; ( aéroport ) airport reference point  means the point described in Part I of the schedule; ( point de repère de l’aéroport ) approach surface  means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; ( surface d’approche ) Minister  means the Minister of Transport; ( ministre ) outer surface  means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; ( surface extérieure ) strip  means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; ( bande ) transitional surface  means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Public Works Plan S-352 dated July 20, 1977 and prepared for the Department of Transport, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to seven feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line production of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
