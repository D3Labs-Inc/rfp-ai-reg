The approach surfaces, shown on Aklavik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2982 dated March 23, 1992, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 12-30 and are described as follows: an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 12 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Aklavik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2982, dated March 23, 1992, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
