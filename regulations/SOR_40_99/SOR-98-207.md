# Summary
A chief firearms officer who issues an authorization to carry shall attach to it the following conditions: if the individual is authorized to possess more than one restricted firearm or prohibited handgun for the purposes of section 20 of the Act, that the individual carry not more than one of them at a time; that the restricted firearm or prohibited handgun be carried in a holster; if the individual needs it for the purpose of a lawful profession or occupation, that the individual notify the chief firearm officer if the individual ceases to be employed or engaged in the lawful profession or occupation or changes employers; and if the individual requires it for the purpose described in paragraph 3(a), that the individual wear a uniform.
A notice of a decision to revoke an authorization to carry is sufficiently given if the notice is addressed to the holder of the authorization at their address that is set out in the application for the authorization or, if the individual has advised the chief firearms officer of a change of that address, at the new address, and the notice is delivered personally, at any time that is reasonable in the circumstances; sent by registered mail or by courier; or transmitted by electronic means that can produce a paper record.
