| 2018-01-13 | The approach surfaces, shown on Oshawa Airport Zoning Plan No. 18-013-80-58, Sheets 1 to 13, dated June 28, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 12-30 and 04-22 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 12 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 04 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 22 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line;

| 1984-06-28 | The approach surfaces, shown on Oshawa Airport Zoning Plan No. 18-013-80-58, Sheets 1 to 13, dated June 28, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 12-30 and 04-22 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 12 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 04 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 22 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-12-30 | The approach surfaces, shown on Oshawa Airport Zoning Plan No. 18-013-80-58, Sheets 1 to 13, dated June 28, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 12-30 and 04-22 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 12 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 04 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 22 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.

| 2018-04-22 | The approach surfaces, shown on Oshawa Airport Zoning Plan No. 18-013-80-58, Sheets 1 to 13, dated June 28, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 12-30 and 04-22 and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 12 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 04 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 50 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 22 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 325 m from the projected centre line;
