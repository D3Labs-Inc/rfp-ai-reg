# Summary
Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 4.4 of the  Aeronautics Act , is pleased hereby to make the annexed  Regulations respecting Zoning at Cranbrook Airport .
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
Each transitional surface, shown on Cranbrook Airport Zoning Plan No. B.C. 1640 (Z) dated January 12, 1987, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surface to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
