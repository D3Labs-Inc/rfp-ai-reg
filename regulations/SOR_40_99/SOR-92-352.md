A bank shall acquire and at all times maintain one or more bonds issued by an entity authorized to insure risks under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the entity carries on business to indemnify the bank for any loss in respect of assets owned or held by that bank arising out of a dishonest or criminal act of an officer or employee of that bank.
A bond or an insurance policy acquired and maintained in accordance with section 10 shall be in an amount that is established by the directors of the bank, having regard to the nature and value of the assets owned or held by the bank; the arrangements and procedures applicable to the handling and safeguarding of the assets owned or held by the bank; and any other factors that might affect the extent of any loss that the bank might sustain.
