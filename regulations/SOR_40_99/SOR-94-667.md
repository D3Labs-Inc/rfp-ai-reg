| 12.0 month | Where a corporation that has established, by affidavit or declaration filed within the previous twelve-month period, that it is a qualified corporation, acquires knowledge that those of its shareholders who are Canadians beneficially own, and control, in the aggregate and otherwise than by way of security only, less than 66 2/3 per cent of its issued and outstanding voting shares, the corporation shall be considered to be a qualified corporation for a period of 12 months from the date it first acquires knowledge of the decrease in the proportion of voting shares below that percentage, notwithstanding that the affidavit or declaration would otherwise be valid for a longer period pursuant to subsection 7(4), if at no time during that 12-month period the proportion of voting shares beneficially owned, and controlled, by Canadians decreases more than five per cent from 66 2/3 per cent; and the corporation, immediately on becoming aware that it is deemed to be a qualified corporation pursuant to this section, so advises in writing the Canadian carrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 60.0 day   | A Canadian carrier shall, in the notice referred to in subsection (1), specify the reasons why the board of the Canadian carrier believes that the voting shares referred to in that subsection are excess voting shares; where the Canadian carrier wishes the registered holder to sell or otherwise dispose of the excess voting shares, specify a date, that is not earlier than 60 days and not later than 180 days after the date of the notice, by which the registered holder shall sell or otherwise dispose of the excess voting shares in favour of Canadians and provide written evidence of the sale or other disposition, or provide written evidence that no such sale or other disposition of excess voting shares is required; and where the board wishes to suspend the voting rights with respect to the excess voting shares identified in the notice, specify that, unless the registered holder complies with the requirement to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares or to provide written evidence pursuant to subparagraph (b)(ii), the voting rights shall be suspended from the date by which the sale or other disposition should have taken place or the evidence should have been provided, and that a sale of those voting shares by the Canadian carrier in accordance with section 11 or a repurchase or redemption by the Canadian carrier in accordance with section 12 may result, in each case without further notice to the registered holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

and where the board wishes to suspend the voting rights with respect to the excess voting shares identified in the notice, specify that, unless the registered holder complies with the requirement to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares or to provide written evidence pursuant to subparagraph (b)(ii), the voting rights shall be suspended from the date by which the sale or other disposition should have taken place or the evidence should have been provided, and that a sale of those voting shares by the Canadian carrier in accordance with section 11 or a repurchase or redemption by the Canadian carrier in accordance with section 12 may result, in each case without further notice to the registered holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10.0 day   | Where, after the sending of a notice referred to in subsection (1), the registered holder provides the Canadian carrier with written evidence that no sale or other disposition of excess

| 60.0 day   | Where the board of the Canadian carrier determines that the shares are excess voting shares and that a sale or other disposition of excess voting shares is required in order to reduce the total number of voting shares of the carrier that are excess voting shares to zero, in the case of a carrier referred to in subsection 16(1) of the Act, or to zero or to any percentage such that the percentage of the voting shares that is beneficially owned, and controlled, by non-Canadians is within five per cent of the percentage of the voting shares of the corporation that were beneficially owned, and controlled, by non-Canadians as at July 22, 1987, in the case of a carrier referred to in subsection 16(2) of the Act, the Canadian carrier shall send a notification to the registered holder of the excess voting shares, informing the registered holder of the board’s determination; confirming that the shares are to be sold or otherwise disposed of by the date specified in the notification; and specifying a further date, that is not later than 60 days after the date of the notification, by which the registered holder shall provide written evidence to the Canadian carrier of the sale or other disposition, failing which the rights of the shareholder to vote with respect to the excess voting shares will be suspended from that further date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 30.0 day   | The Commission may exercise the relevant powers referred to in subsection (2), where the Commission has given the Canadian carrier notice of the Commission’s intention to exercise the carrier’s powers, and the reasons therefor; the Commission has provided the Canadian carrier with at least 30 days after the Canadian carrier receives the notice to exercise the powers referred to in subsection (2); the Canadian carrier has not exercised the powers within the period specified by the Commission in the notice;

or a percentage that is equal to, or within five percent of, the percentage of the voting shares of the Canadian carrier that were beneficially owned, and controlled, by non-Canadians as at July 22, 1987, in the case of a corporation referred to in subsection 16(2) of the Act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2018-05-12 | A Canadian carrier shall, in the notice referred to in subsection (1), specify the reasons why the board of the Canadian carrier believes that the voting shares referred to in that subsection are excess voting shares; where the Canadian carrier wishes the registered holder to sell or otherwise dispose of the excess voting shares, specify a date, that is not earlier than 60 days and not later than 180 days after the date of the notice, by which the registered holder shall sell or otherwise dispose of the excess voting shares in favour of Canadians and provide written evidence of the sale or other disposition, or provide written evidence that no such sale or other disposition of excess voting shares is required; and where the board wishes to suspend the voting rights with respect to the excess voting shares identified in the notice, specify that, unless the registered holder complies with the requirement to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares or to provide written evidence pursuant to subparagraph (b)(ii), the voting rights shall be suspended from the date by which the sale or other disposition should have taken place or the evidence should have been provided, and that a sale of those voting shares by the Canadian carrier in accordance with section 11 or a repurchase or redemption by the Canadian carrier in accordance with section 12 may result, in each case without further notice to the registered holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1987-07-22 | Where the board of the Canadian carrier determines that the shares are excess voting shares and that a sale or other disposition of excess voting shares is required in order to reduce the total number of voting shares of the carrier that are excess voting shares to zero, in the case of a carrier referred to in subsection 16(1) of the Act, or to zero or to any percentage such that the percentage of the voting shares that is beneficially owned, and controlled, by non-Canadians is within five per cent of the percentage of the voting shares of the corporation that were beneficially owned, and controlled, by non-Canadians as at July 22, 1987, in the case of a carrier referred to in subsection 16(2) of the Act, the Canadian carrier shall send a notification to the registered holder of the excess voting shares, informing the registered holder of the board’s determination;

or a percentage that is equal to, or within five per cent of, the percentage of the voting shares of the carrier that were beneficially owned, and controlled, by non-Canadians as at July 22, 1987, where the corporation is an acquiring corporation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2018-05-24 | A carrier holding corporation shall, in the notice referred to in subsection (1), specify the reasons why the board of the carrier holding corporation believes that the voting shares referred to in that subsection are holdco excess voting shares; where the carrier holding corporation wishes the registered holder to sell or otherwise dispose of the holdco excess voting shares identified in the notice, specify a date, that is not earlier than 60 days and not later than 180 days after the date of the notice, by which the registered holder shall sell or otherwise dispose of the holdco excess voting shares in favour of Canadians and provide written evidence of the sale or other disposition, or provide written evidence that no such sale or other disposition of holdco excess voting shares is required; and where the board wishes to suspend the voting rights with respect to the holdco excess voting shares identified in the notice, specify that, unless the registered holder complies with the requirement to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares or provide written evidence pursuant to subparagraph (b)(ii), the voting rights shall be suspended from the date on which the sale or other disposition should have taken place or the evidence should have been provided and that a sale of those voting shares by the carrier holding corporation in accordance with section 23 or a repurchase or redemption by the carrier holding corporation in accordance with section 24 may result, in each case without further notice to the registered holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
