# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2847, dated October 16, 1990, is a point located on the centre line of runway 129-309 distant 914.4 m from the threshold of runway 309.
The outer surface, shown on Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2847, dated October 16, 1990, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2847, dated October 16, 1990, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The outer limit, shown on Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2847, dated October 16, 1990, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
