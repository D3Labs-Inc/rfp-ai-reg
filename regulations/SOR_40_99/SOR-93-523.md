# Summary
The airport reference point, shown on Coppermine Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2924, dated September 3, 1991, is a point located on the centre line of runway 121-301 distant 762 m from the threshold of runway 301.
The outer surface, shown on Coppermine Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2924, dated September 3, 1991, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Coppermine Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2924, dated September 3, 1991, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Coppermine Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2924, dated September 3, 1991, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
