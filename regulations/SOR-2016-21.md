# Summary
Existing project For each existing project that was previously under a regulatory activity plan, after approval of the Board’s budget in any given fiscal year following its submission in accordance with subsection 27(2) of the Act, the Board must prepare a new regulatory activity plan; calculate the estimated annual charge payable by the applicant or the operator for the project by determining the estimated full cost, including indirect regulatory costs, associated with the implementation of thenew regulatory activity plan based on the cost of the estimated total number of units of time necessary to be spent in that fiscal year on direct regulatory activities for the project, and any other costs, excluding costs calculated under other cost recovery methods; and notify the applicant or the operator, in writing, of the new regulatory activity plan and the estimated annual charge payable.
