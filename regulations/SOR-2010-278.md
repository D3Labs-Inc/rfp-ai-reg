# Summary
Primary producers without an export history If none of a primary producer’s products were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period and if the primary producer produced Quebec softwood lumber products during the period beginning on January 1, 2007 and ending on December 31, 2009 and it applies for an export allocation, the primary producer may only receive the allocation of the Quebec quantity determined by the formula in subsection 10(1) (which is based on its historic production volume).
Allocation to remanufacturers Subject to subsection (2), the allocation of the Quebec quantity to a remanufacturer that is based on its historic export volume is determined by the formula QQ × (RE/TEQ) where QQ is the Quebec quantity; RE is the volume of the remanufacturer’s products that were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period; and TEQ is the total volume of primary producers’ and remanufacturers’ products that were exported from Quebec to the United States under export permits during the reference period, excluding the volume of products of primary producers and remanufacturers who relinquish their export allocations for 2011.
