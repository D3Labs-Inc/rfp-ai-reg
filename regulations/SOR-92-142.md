# Summary
The airport reference point shown on Hall Beach Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2740 dated August 3, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 124T-304T distant 792.5 m from the threshold of runway 304T.
The outer surface, shown on Hall Beach Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2740 dated August 3, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The strip associated with runway 124T-304T, shown on Hall Beach Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2740 dated August 3, 1989, is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 705 m in length.
The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Hall Beach Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2740 dated August 3, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centered on the airport reference point.
