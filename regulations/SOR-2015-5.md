| 24.0 hour   | A diving supervisor must plan dives in such a manner that the total bottom time of a diver supervised by the supervisor does not exceed, in any 24-hour period, in the case of a category I dive, five hours at depths of 20 m or less, or three hours at depths of more than 20 m; in the case of a category II dive, three hours; and in the case of a category III dive, eight hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5 hour      | A diving supervisor must plan dives in such a manner that the total bottom time of a diver supervised by the supervisor does not exceed, in any 24-hour period, in the case of a category I dive, five hours at depths of 20 m or less, or three hours at depths of more than 20 m; in the case of a category II dive, three hours; and in the case of a category III dive, eight hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3 hour      | A diving supervisor must plan dives in such a manner that the total bottom time of a diver supervised by the supervisor does not exceed, in any 24-hour period, in the case of a category I dive, five hours at depths of 20 m or less, or three hours at depths of more than 20 m; in the case of a category II dive, three hours; and in the case of a category III dive, eight hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3 hour      | A diving supervisor must plan dives in such a manner that the total bottom time of a diver supervised by the supervisor does not exceed, in any 24-hour period, in the case of a category I dive, five hours at depths of 20 m or less, or three hours at depths of more than 20 m; in the case of a category II dive, three hours; and in the case of a category III dive, eight hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 8 hour      | A diving supervisor must plan dives in such a manner that the total bottom time of a diver supervised by the supervisor does not exceed, in any 24-hour period, in the case of a category I dive, five hours at depths of 20 m or less, or three hours at depths of more than 20 m; in the case of a category II dive, three hours; and in the case of a category III dive, eight hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 30.0 minute | A diving supervisor must not permit a diver supervised by the supervisor to make a dive that is part of a diving operation from a place referred to in paragraph 5(1)(b) that is unsuitable; a craft that has insufficient power or stability for the safe conduct of the dive; a dive site located more than 2 m above the water unless a suitable skip, diving bell or diving submersible is used to transport the diver through the air-water interface; a dynamically positioned craft unless the craft has been operating in the dynamically positioned mode for at least 30 minutes before the diver enters the water, the range of surge or sway movement of the water at the dive site is less than 80% of the maximum operational capacity limit of the craft, a skip or a diving bell is positioned as close as possible to the diverâ€™s underwater work site, all reasonable precautions are taken to prevent any umbilical used in the dive from coming into contact with any propeller or manoeuvring unit of the craft, any change of heading or positioning of the craft, at any time that a diver involved in the diving operation is in the water, is made only after the diving supervisor has granted permission for the change and the diver has been notified, and the craft complies with the requirements of section 24; and a craft that is underway, except in the case of an emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 12.0 hour   | A diving supervisor must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that, except in the event of the evacuation of a diver during a diving operation supervised by the diving supervisor, a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a dive does not fly in an aircraft for 12 hours after a non-decompression dive, for 24 hours after decompression, or for any longer period that the diving supervisor considers necessary to ensure that the diver does not suffer decompression sickness; and a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a saturation dive remains under observation in the general area of the decompression chamber for at least 24 hours after decompression or any longer period that is sufficient in the opinion of the diving supervisor to ensure the well-being of the diver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 24.0 hour   | A diving supervisor must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that, in the evacuation of a person during a diving operation supervised by the supervisor, a person involved in the diving operation who has completed decompression within the preceding 24 hours does not fly in an aircraft at an altitude greater than is operationally necessary in the circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24.0 hour   | A supervisor must not, in a diving operation supervised by the supervisor, use any diving plant and equipment in the diving operation unless the appropriate examinations and tests referred to in subsection 10(1) have been carried out on the diving plant and equipment and the certificates related to those examinations and tests have been inserted into or attached to the register referred to in subsection 10(3); and the supervisor has, not more than 24 hours before the use, examined the diving plant and equipment in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable procedures manual and found them to be in good working order, and when appropriate, in addition to the examination referred to in subparagraph (i), tested for leaks any pump, compressor, cylinder or pipeline used in the diving operation to convey breathing mixture and found it free from leaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1 hour      | A diving supervisor must not conduct a dive unless a two-compartment compression chamber that is located in a readily accessible place on board the craft or installation from which the dive is conducted, except when the dive is conducted at a depth of 10 m or less, in which case the compression chamber may be located within one hourâ€™s travelling time from the dive site, has been approved in accordance with section 4 for the diving program of which the dive is a part, to be used at a pressure that is not less than six atmospheres absolute or, if the maximum working pressure that may be encountered during the dive is greater than six atmospheres absolute, at the maximum pressure plus one atmosphere; and is suitable for the dive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2 hour      | When an analyzer is used continuously in a diving operation to determine the relative levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide during any dive that is part of the diving operation, the supervisor must ensure that the analyzer is recalibrated in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for the analyzer, where practicable, every two hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 30.0 minute | When a person involved in a diving operation is in a compression chamber, the supervisor must keep a record or ensure that a record is kept, at regular intervals of not more than 30 minutes, of the time and depth gauge readings and of the main components of the atmosphere in the compression chamber, including the oxygen and carbon dioxide; and the temperature and humidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 14.0 day    | A diver must not make a saturation dive unless in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of 14 daysâ€™ duration or less, at least 14 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression; and in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of more than 14 daysâ€™ duration, at least 28 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14.0 day    | A diver must not make a saturation dive unless in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of 14 daysâ€™ duration or less, at least 14 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression; and in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of more than 14 daysâ€™ duration, at least 28 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28.0 day    | A diver must not make a saturation dive unless in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of 14 daysâ€™ duration or less, at least 14 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression; and in the case of a diver whose most recent dive was a saturation dive of more than 14 daysâ€™ duration, at least 28 days have elapsed since the diver completed decompression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 2018-12-01 | A diving supervisor must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that, except in the event of the evacuation of a diver during a diving operation supervised by the diving supervisor, a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a dive does not fly in an aircraft for 12 hours after a non-decompression dive, for 24 hours after decompression, or for any longer period that the diving supervisor considers necessary to ensure that the diver does not suffer decompression sickness; and a diver involved in the diving operation who has completed a saturation dive remains under observation in the general area of the decompression chamber for at least 24 hours after decompression or any longer period that is sufficient in the opinion of the diving supervisor to ensure the well-being of the diver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
