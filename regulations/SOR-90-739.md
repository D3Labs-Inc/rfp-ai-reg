# Summary
Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
The airport reference point shown on Swan River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2633 dated April 30, 1988, is a point located on the centre line of runway 02-20 distant 629.0 m from the northeasterly end of the said runway.
The outer surface, shown on Swan River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2633 dated April 30, 1988, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
