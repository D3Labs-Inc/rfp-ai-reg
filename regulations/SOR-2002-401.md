# Summary
The Director-General has the right and the duty to waive the immunity granted to a designated senior official in any case where, in the opinion of the Director-General, the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of UNESCO.
Designated officials shall be immune from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity; if they are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents, be exempt from taxation on the salaries and emoluments paid to them by UNESCO; be immune, together with their spouses and relatives dependent on them, from immigration restrictions and alien registration; be immune from national service obligations; be given, together with their spouses and relatives dependent on them, the same repatriation facilities in time of international crisis as diplomatic envoys; be accorded the same privileges in respect of exchange facilities as are accorded to the officials of comparable ranks forming part of diplomatic missions to the Government of Canada; and have the right to import free of duty their furniture and effects at the time of first taking up their post in Canada.
