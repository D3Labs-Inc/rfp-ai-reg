3. An association shall not, in relation to its business in Canada, promote an insurance policy of an insurance company, agent or broker, or a service in respect of such a policy, unless the policy is of an authorized type of insurance or the service is in respect of such a policy; the policy is not of an authorized type of insurance and is restricted to insuring the risks of the association, a local cooperative credit society that is a member of the association or an affiliate of the association, and does not in any way insure the risks of a customer arising from a transaction with the customer.
