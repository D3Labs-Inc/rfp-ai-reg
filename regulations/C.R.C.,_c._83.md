# Summary
In these Regulations, airport  means the Gander International Airport, in the District of Gander-Twillingate, in the Province of Newfoundland; ( aéroport ) airport reference point  means the point described in Part I of the schedule; ( point de repère de l’aéroport ) approach surface  means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a strip, along and at right angles to the projected centre line thereof, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; ( surface d’approche ) Minister  means the Minister of Transport; ( ministre ) outer surface  means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; ( surface extérieure ) strip  means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; ( bande ) transitional surface  means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.
