# Summary
3, 1976 APPROPRIATION ACTS Regulations Respecting Payments in Lieu of Development and Redevelopment Taxes on Federal Property.
Subject to section 4, on receipt of an application from a municipality in a form prescribed by the Minister, the Minister may pay to the municipality, in respect of federal property, a grant in lieu of a development tax or redevelopment tax not exceeding the amount of tax that would be payable if federal property were taxable property.
The Minister may, in determining the amount of a grant payable to a municipality under these Regulations in respect of federal property within a defined area, deduct from the amount that would otherwise be payable an amount that, in the opinion of the Minister, is equal to the product of the total proceeds of the development tax or redevelopment tax in respect of that area multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which is the said total proceeds and the numerator of which is that portion of the said total proceeds that relates to the financing of services of a kind that the federal government, at its own expense, has carried out, is carrying out or plans to carry out.
These Regulations apply in respect of a development tax or redevelopment tax on federal property that would, if the federal property were taxable property, have become due and payable on or after January 1, 1974.
