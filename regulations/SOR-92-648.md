# Summary
The outer surface, shown on North Battleford Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2745 dated November 30, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
The transitional surfaces, shown on North Battleford Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2745 dated November 30, 1989, are described as follows: the transitional surfaces associated with runway 06-24 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and the transitional surfaces associated with runway 12-30 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 1989-11-30 | The approach surfaces, shown on North Battleford Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2745 dated November 30, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with runways designated 06-24 and 12-30, and are described as follows: a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 06 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 20 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 280 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 125 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 24 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 20 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip;

| 1989-11-30 | The outer surface, shown on North Battleford Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2745 dated November 30, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.

| 1989-11-30 | The transitional surfaces, shown on North Battleford Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2745 dated November 30, 1989, are described as follows: the transitional surfaces associated with runway 06-24 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and the transitional surfaces associated with runway 12-30 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.

| 2018-06-24 | The transitional surfaces, shown on North Battleford Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2745 dated November 30, 1989, are described as follows: the transitional surfaces associated with runway 06-24 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and the transitional surfaces associated with runway 12-30 are inclined planes rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
