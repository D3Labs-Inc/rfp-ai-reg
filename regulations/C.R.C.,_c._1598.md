# Summary
Subject to this section, the Attorney General may waive the primary right of a civil court to exercise jurisdiction in respect of any act or omission constituting an offence against any law in force in Canada alleged to have been committed by a member of a visiting force in favour of a service court of the visiting force by sending a waiver signed by the Attorney General, in Form 1 set out in the schedule or to the like effect, to the officer in command of the visiting force, where no information has been laid against the member before the civil court in respect of the act or omission; or by complying with paragraph (a) and by sending a copy of the waiver to the judge, magistrate or justice who presides over the civil court, where such an information has been laid.
