| 1991-10-15 | Conditions for the collection of data For the purpose of subsection (2), both of the following conditions are to be used to determine the amount of an emission: the conditions set out in the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 3308, Third Edition 1991-10-15, entitled  Routine analytical cigarette-smoking machine — Definitions and standard conditions , 1991 (E); and the conditions referred to in paragraph (a), but modified in the following manner: puff volume must be increased from 35 mL to 55 mL, puff interval must be decreased from 60 s to 30 s, and all ventilation holes must be blocked by placing over them a strip of Mylar adhesive tape, Scotch Brand product no. 600 Transparent Tape, and the tape must be cut so that it covers the circumference and is tightly secured from the end of the filter to the tipping overwrap seam, or by another method of equivalent efficiency.

| 2018-12-01 | Exemption — functional relationship of certain emissions A manufacturer may, on or before December 1 of the year preceding the year for which the exemption is sought, apply to the Minister for an exemption from the requirement to submit a report under subsection (1) in respect of the emissions for mainstream or sidestream smoke of a brand of a designated tobacco product specified by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer provides to the Minister the content and results of a statistical analysis done under the conditions referred to in subsection (12), that demonstrates, within a 95% confidence limit and in relation to the type of emission exemption sought, the existence of a functional linear relationship between tar and each of the other emissions, other than nicotine, produced from the combustion of the designated tobacco product by using the following formula: y=mx+b where y is the amount of the other emission, m is the slope, x is the mean amount of tar as determined by 7 replicates, and b is the intercept, by applying a regression analysis to the results obtained under subparagraph (i), and by applying an F-test to the results obtained under that subparagraph; and between nicotine and the other emissions produced from the combustion of the designated tobacco product, by making the calculation and applying the analysis and test described in paragraph (a), except that the references to “tar” in subparagraph (i), other than in the description of “y”, shall be read as references to “nicotine”.
