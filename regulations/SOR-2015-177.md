# Summary
Applications affecting contours of footprint If the owner or operator of an aquaculture facility located in tidal waters that cultivates finfish makes an application under federal or provincial law that, if approved, would authorize any activity that is likely to increase the predicted contours of the footprint of the biochemical oxygen demanding matter deposited by the facility, the owner or the operator must conduct the studies necessary to obtain the information referred to in paragraphs  8 (1)(a) to (d) and submit the information to the Minister within 30 days after the day on which the application was made.
Notification of Minister The owner or operator of an aquaculture facility that cultivates finfish that is located in tidal waters in or adjacent to Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland and Labrador must notify the Minister if the following occurs: the concentration limits set out in subparagraph  10 (1)(b)(i) are exceeded; or Beggiatoa species or similar bacteria, marine worms or barren substrate are present to the extent referred to in paragraph 11(2)(b).
