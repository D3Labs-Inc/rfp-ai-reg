# Summary
Prohibition — interference A person must not use or develop, or permit another person to use or develop, any of the lands that are under the outer surface in a manner that causes interference with any signal or communication to and from an aircraft or to and from any facility used to provide services relating to aeronautics.
The outer surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary surface extending outward from the airport reference point to a radius of 4 000 m.
Each transitional surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary inclined surface ascending at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip surface, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces to the intersection with the outer surface.
The limit of the area containing the lands to which these Regulations apply is defined by a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan.
