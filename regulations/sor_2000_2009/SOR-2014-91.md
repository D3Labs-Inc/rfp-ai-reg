# Summary
Aquatic research The power that is conferred by subsection 36(5.2) of the Act may be exercised by the Minister of the Environment in relation to research activities if the persons authorized by the Regulations to deposit deleterious substances have processes in place or are subject to processes to verify that the research activities will contribute to the development of knowledge for the purpose of managing, conserving, protecting or restoring fish populations or waters frequented by fish, the research activities will be conducted under the supervision of a person who has expertise in conducting aquatic research under similar conditions, as evidenced by a substantial and relevant peer-reviewed publication record, the research activities will be designed so as to avoid harmful effects on fish, fish habitat and the use by man of fish, other than the effects that are necessary to achieve results that are scientifically valid, and confine any harmful effects on fish, fish habitat or the use by man of fish to the waters in respect of which the deposit is authorized, and if research activities render any waters frequented by fish unsuitable to sustain fish populations or render fish populations unsuitable for human consumption, no later than 20 years following the day on which the research activities are completed, the waters will be suitable to sustain fish populations and the fish populations will be suitable for human consumption; to evaluate whether the research activities will be carried out in accordance with their design and to document any deviations from that design; and to make research findings available to the public.
