# Summary
transitional surface surface de transition transitional surface  means an imaginary inclined surface that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces and that is described in Part 5 of the schedule.
The outer surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary surface extending outward from the airport reference point to a radius of 4 000 m.
The strip surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary rectangular surface described as follows: the strip surface associated with runway 02-20 is 150 m in total width, being 75 m on either side of the centre line of the runway.
Each transitional surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary inclined surface ascending at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip surface, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces to the intersection with the outer surface.
The limit of the area containing the lands to which these Regulations apply is defined by a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan.
