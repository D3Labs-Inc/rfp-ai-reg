# Summary
The application for authorization shall be accompanied by a description of the scope of the proposed activities; an execution plan and schedule for undertaking those activities; a safety plan that meets the requirements of section 8; an environmental protection plan that meets the requirements of section 9; information on any proposed flaring or venting of gas, including the rationale and the estimated rate, quantity and period of the flaring or venting; information on any proposed burning of oil, including the rationale and the estimated quantity of oil proposed to be burned; in the case of a drilling installation, a description of the drilling and well control equipment; in the case of a production installation, a description of the processing facilities and control system; in the case of a production project, a field data acquisition program that allows sufficient pool pressure measurements, fluid samples, cased hole logs and formation flow tests for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of development wells, pool depletion schemes and the field; contingency plans, including emergency response procedures, to mitigate the effects of any reasonably foreseeable event that might compromise safety or environmental protection, which shall provide for coordination measures with any relevant municipal, provincial, territorial or federal emergency response plan, and in an area where oil is reasonably expected to be encountered, identify the scope and frequency of the field practice exercise of oil spill countermeasures; and a description of the decommissioning and abandonment of the site, including methods for restoration of the site after its abandonment.
