# Summary
Factors that must be considered Each environmental assessment of a project shall consider the following factors: the environmental effects of the project, including the environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the project, and any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities that have been or will be undertaken; the significance of those environmental effects; any comments from the public that are received in accordance with the first nationâ€™s oil and gas law; technically and economically feasible measures that would mitigate any significant adverse environmental effects of the project; and any other matter relevant to a screening, comprehensive study, mediation or assessment by a review panel, such as the need for the project and alternatives to the project, whose consideration may be required by the decision-making authority or, except in the case of a screening, the council of the first nation.
