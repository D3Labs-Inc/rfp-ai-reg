# Summary
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations.
2000-348 Whereas, pursuant to subsection 332(1) of the  Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 a , the Minister of the Environment published in the  Canada Gazette , Part I, on December 11, 1999, a copy of the proposed  Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations , substantially in the annexed form, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection; S.C. 1999, c.
bioaccumulation factor  means the ratio of the concentration of a substance in an organism to the concentration in water, based on uptake from the surrounding medium and food.
( facteur de bioaccumulation ) bioconcentration factor  means the ratio of the concentration of a substance in an organism to the concentration in water, based only on uptake from the surrounding medium.
These Regulations apply to any substance, other than a living organism within the meaning of Part 6 of the  Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 .
