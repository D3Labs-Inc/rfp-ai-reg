# Summary
Determination In determining whether an acquisition referred to in section 373 of the Act would, if approved by the Minister, give a person control, within the meaning of paragraph 3(1)(d) of the Act, of a federal credit union, the policy objectives set out in section 4 must be considered.
Policy objectives The following policy objectives must be considered for the purpose of a determination referred to in section 3, taking into account the factors set out in section 5: preserving the benefits of the ownership rules applicable to federal credit unions, including continuing the organization and operation of federal credit unions on a cooperative basis, maintaining a high degree of transparency and member and shareholder oversight over federal credit unions, lessening the risk of distortions by federal credit unions in their credit allocation that may result from links with investors, and enhancing the safety and soundness of federal credit unions; allowing federal credit unions to manage their day-to-day operations and to develop their strategic visions by taking into account their best interests, as opposed to the best interests of any single member or shareholder, any group of members or shareholders, or any person or group of persons with which the federal credit unions have a business relationship; and allowing investors in federal credit unions to exercise the degree of influence necessary to gain the benefits of their investments, including allowing them to account for their investments using the equity accounting method in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
