# Summary
Abnormal burning A gas lighter, when tested in accordance with the procedures described in sections 5, 6 and 8 to 10 of the schedule, must not exhibit a sudden increase in flame height of 50 mm or more; a vertical flame height in excess of the maximum values, as the case may be, specified in subsection 6(1); an explosion; combustion at any place other than at the fuel orifice of the lighter or in the main flame; an escape of liquid fuel that produces a shower of burning droplets that separate from the main flame; or any other abnormal or unsafe burning characteristics.
Drop test — procedures The following procedures are to be used in conducting a gas lighter drop test: if the lighter has a device to adjust the flame height, adjust it to produce a flame height of 50 mm; maintain the lighter at a temperature of -10 ± 2°C for at least 10 hours, and then maintain it at a temperature of 23 ± 2°C for at least 10 hours; immediately after the procedure described in paragraph (b), cause the lighter to fall three times onto the horizontally positioned concrete slab from a height of 1.5 m first, from an upright vertical position, second, from an inverted vertical position, and third, from a horizontal position; inspect the lighter immediately after each fall for escape of fuel and record any damage; and measure and record any escape of fuel to the nearest milligram per minute.
