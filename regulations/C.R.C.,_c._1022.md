# Summary
Where a contributor referred to in section 3 defaults in respect of an instalment payable by him, payment of the amount in default with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum shall be payable in a lump sum immediately on demand, or in monthly instalments for the lesser of the life of the contributor, or the remainder of the period during which instalments under subsection (1) are to be paid, as the contributor elects, computed in accordance with Canadian Life Tables 1970-72 on the amount that is in default to the date of the demand, with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum.
Where any amount payable by a contributor under these Regulations has become due but remains unpaid at the time of his death, the Minister shall, if the amount with interest is not paid forthwith by the personal representative of the contributor, demand payment from the surviving spouse of the contributor to whom a pension is payable under the Act and if the amount with interest to the date of demand is not paid, it may be recovered at any time and, without prejudice to any other recourse available to Her Majesty with respect to the recovery thereof, by retention, by way of deduction or set-off out of the pension payable to the spouse, in a lump sum immediately, or in instalments for a term specified by the Minister, as the recipient elects, with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum.
