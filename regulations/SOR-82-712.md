# Summary
The outer surface, shown on Department of Transport Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Plan B.C. 1421 dated December 31, 1980, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, an imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.
Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Transport Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Plan No. B.C. 1421 dated December 31, 1980, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
