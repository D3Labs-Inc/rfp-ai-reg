| 5 year     | Since the FCRA provides that opt-out elections can expire in a period of no less than five years, an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer must provide a renewal notice to the consumer after such time in order to allow its affiliates to make solicitations.                                                                                                                               |
| 5 year     | Each opt-out renewal must be effective for a period of at least five years as provided in &#167;&#8201;162.4(b) of this subpart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30.0 day   | A card issuer must establish and implement reasonable policies and procedures to assess the validity of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of address for a consumer's debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account. |
