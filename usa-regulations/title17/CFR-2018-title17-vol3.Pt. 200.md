| 10 year    | A renewal request will likewise expire ten years from the date that Office receives it, unless that Office receives another timely renewal request which complies with the requirements of this paragraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10 day     | (1) If it is determined that records which are the subject of a request for access under the Freedom of Information Act are also the subject of a request for confidential treatment under this rule and no other grounds appear to exist which would justify the withholding of the records [e.g., Freedom of Information Act Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A)], the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer promptly shall so inform the person requesting confidential treatment or, in the case of a request made on behalf of a person other than the submitter, the person identified as able to provide substantiation, by telephone, facsimile or certified mail and require that substantiation of the request for confidential treatment be submitted in ten calendar days. |
| 10 day     | Failure to submit a written substantiation within ten calendar days from the time of notification, or any extension thereof, may be deemed a waiver of the confidential treatment request and the confidential treatment requester's right to appeal an initial decision denying confidential treatment to the Commission's General Counsel as permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10 day     | (1) In a preliminary decision, which shall be sent by mail or facsimile, or both, the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations will inform the confidential treatment requester whether it intends to grant confidentiality in whole or in part and give the requester ten calendar days from the date of the preliminary decision to submit supplemental arguments if the requester disagrees with the preliminary decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10 day     | A final decision, which shall also be sent by mail or facsimile, or both, no sooner than ten calendar days from the date of the preliminary decision, shall inform the Freedom of Information Act requester and the confidential treatment requester of his or her right to appeal an adverse decision to the Commission's General Counsel within ten calendar days from the date of the final decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10 day     | A final decision, which shall also be sent by mail or facsimile, or both, no sooner than ten calendar days from the date of the preliminary decision, shall inform the Freedom of Information Act requester and the confidential treatment requester of his or her right to appeal an adverse decision to the Commission's General Counsel within ten calendar days from the date of the final decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10 day     | Records, which the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Officer determines to be releasable, may be released to the Freedom of Information Act requester ten calendar days after the date of the final decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10 day     | However, if within those ten calendar days, the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Officer receives an appeal from the confidential treatment requester, he or she shall inform the Freedom of Information Act requester that an appeal is pending and that the records will not be released until the appeal is resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10 day     | Disclosure of the information under the Freedom of Information Act will occur ten calendar days after notice to the person requesting confidential treatment, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (e) (5) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10 day     | (5) If within that ten calendar day period the General Counsel has been notified that the person requesting confidential treatment has commenced an action in a Federal court concerning the determination to make such information publicly available, the General Counsel will stay making the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10 day     | If the stay is vacated, the information will be released under the Freedom of Information Act ten calendar days after the person requesting confidential treatment is notified of this action by telephone, if possible, with a facsimile or certified mail letter sent to the person's last known address, unless the court orders otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
