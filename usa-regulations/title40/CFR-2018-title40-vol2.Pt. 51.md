| 3.0 year    | (c) If your state chooses the method of inventorying one-third of your sources that are not Type A point sources and triennial inventory nonpoint, nonroad mobile, and onroad mobile sources each year, your state must compile each year of the 3-year period identically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3.0 year    | For example, if a process has not changed for a source category or individual plant, your state must use the same emission factors to calculate emissions for each year of the 3-year period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3.0 year    | If your state has revised emission factors during the 3 years for a process that has not changed, you must compute previous years' data using the revised factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 1.0 hour    | (a)(1) The Administrator finds that the State implementation plan (SIP) for each jurisdiction listed in paragraph (c) of this section is substantially inadequate to comply with the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I), because the SIP does not include adequate provisions to prohibit sources and other activities from emitting nitrogen oxides (&#8220;NOX&#8221;) in amounts that will contribute significantly to nonattainment in one or more other States with respect to the 1-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 5.0 year    | (A) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 24.0 month  | (2) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive 24-month period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24.0 month  | (3) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 24.0 month  | (4) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (a)(1)(xxxv)(A)(2) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
