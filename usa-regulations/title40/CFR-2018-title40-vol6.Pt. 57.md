| 1977-08-07 | (a) A primary copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, or other nonferrous smelter is eligible for an NSO if it meets the following conditions:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (1) The smelter was in existence and operating on August 7, 1977;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1977-08-07 | (b) Active use refers to an SO2 constant control system installed at a smelter before August 7, 1977 and not totally removed from regular service by that date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1977-08-07 | (q) Maximum production capacity means either the maximum demonstrated rate at which a smelter has produced its principal metallic final product under the process equipment configuration and operating procedures prevailing on or before August 7, 1977, or a rate which the smelter is able to demonstrate by calculation is attainable with process equipment existing on August 7, 1977.                                                                 |

| 1988-01-01 | No NSO issued under this regulation shall expire later than January 1, 1988.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1988-01-01 | (2)(i) If the smelter is determined to be eligible for an NSO under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the issuing Agency shall apply the appendix A financial eligibility tests again before issuing an NSO in order to determine if the smelter can comply with its SIP requirements on or before January 1, 1988 by installing adequately demonstrated technology which is reasonably available.                                                            |
| 1988-01-01 | (ii) If application of the tests shows that the smelter could comply by or before January 1, 1988, the issuing agency shall notify the smelter of this determination, and shall not issue an NSO to the smelter unless the NSO contains a SIP compliance schedule meeting the requirements of &#167;&#8201;57.705.                                                                                                                                            |
| 1988-01-01 | Such a compliance schedule must provide for compliance with the smelter's SO2 SIP as expeditiously as practicable and in no case later than January 1, 1988.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1988-01-01 | (iii) If no adequately demonstrated technology is found to be reasonably available to enable a smelter to comply by January 1, 1988, it would be excused from the compliance schedule requirement in &#167;&#8201;57.201(d)(2)(ii), but it would be subject to reevaluation of its ability to comply by that date at any time during the term of the NSO.                                                                                                     |
| 1988-01-01 | If EPA or the issuing agency determines that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably available to permit the smelter to comply with its SIP by or before January 1, 1988, the NSO shall be amended within 3 months time after such determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1988-01-01 | The amendment shall require compliance with all SIP requirements by or before January 1, 1988, and shall include a compliance schedule meeting the requirements of &#167;&#8201;57.705.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1988-01-01 | (2) EPA can make a determination that the smelter is eligible for a second period NSO and whether the smelter can comply with its SO2 SIP limits on or before January 1, 1988 under the financial eligibility tests in these regulations on the basis of available information and such supplementary information as the Agency may request the smelter to submit; and                                                                                        |
|            |               (3) The provisions of the NSO are consistent with the requirements of these regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1988-01-01 | If the issuing agency determines that the demonstrated control technology necessary to attain the new SO2 SIP limit is adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available under the eligibility tests, so as to permit the smelter to comply with the new SIP limit on or before January 1, 1988, the NSO shall be amended within the time contemplated by &#167;&#8201;57.202(a) after receipt of the supplementary information.                             |
| 1977-08-07 | (e) In all primary nonferrous smelters, any other process streams which were regularly or intermittently treated by constant controls at the smelter as of August 7, 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1977-08-07 | Each NSO shall contain a requirement limiting the total allowable emissions from the smelter to the level which would have been associated with production at the smelter's maximum production capacity (as defined in &#167;&#8201;57.103(r)) as of August 7, 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1977-08-07 | Excess emissions occurring during scheduled maintenance shall not constitute violations of the NSO to the extent that:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (1) The expected additional annual sulfur dioxide removal by any control system (including associated process changes) for which construction had not commenced (as defined in 40 CFR 60.2 (g) and (i)) as of August 7, 1977 and which the smelter owner agrees to install and operate under subpart F, would have offset such excess emissions if the system had been in operation throughout the year in which the maintenance was performed; |
|            |               (2) The system is installed and operated as provided in the NSO provisions established under subpart F; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|            |               (3) The system performs at substantially the expected efficiency and reliability subsequent to its initial break-in period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1988-01-02 | (b) The requirements of this subpart may be waived with respect to a smelter if the owner of that smelter submits with its NSO application a written certification by a corporate official authorized to make such a certification that the smelter will either comply with its SO2 SIP limits by January 2, 1988 or close after January 1, 1988 until it can comply with such limits.                                                                        |
