| 3 year     | (a) Not later than February 4, 1989, each State shall submit to the Regional Administrator for review, approval, and implementation an individual control strategy for each point source identified by the State pursuant to section 304(l)(1)(C) of the Act which discharges to a water identified by the State pursuant to section 304(l)(1)(B) which will produce a reduction in the discharge of toxic pollutants from the point sources identified under section 304(l)(1)(C) through the establishment of effluent limitations under section 402 of the CWA and water quality standards under section 303(c)(2)(B) of the CWA, which reduction is sufficient, in combination with existing controls on point and nonpoint sources of pollution, to achieve the applicable water quality standard as soon as possible, but not later than three years after the date of establishment of such strategy. |
| 3 year     | (c) For the purposes of this section the term individual control strategy, as set forth in section 304(l) of the CWA, means a final NPDES permit with supporting documentation showing that effluent limits are consistent with an approved wasteload allocation, or other documentation which shows that applicable water quality standards will be met not later than three years after the individual control strategy is established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
