| 2018-05-05 | (4) At the option of the NPDES permitting authority, in lieu of the parameter BOD5 and the levels of the effluent quality specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3), the parameter CBOD5 may be substituted with the following levels of the CBOD5 effluent quality provided: |
|            |             (i) The 30-day average shall not exceed 25 mg/l.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2018-05-05 | (2) Where data are available, the parameter CBOD5 may be used for effluent quality limitations established under paragraph (d) of this section.                                                                                                                                       |
