| (250.0, 'USD') | (2) Where the agency determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester that has a history of prompt payment. |
| (50.0, 'USD')  | If you make a Privacy Act request for access to records, it will be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under &#167;&#8201;304.27, up to $50.00.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
