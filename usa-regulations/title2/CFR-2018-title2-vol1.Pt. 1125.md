# Title

 Grants and Agreements. PART 1125â€”NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION


# ID

# Summary

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Department of Defense (DoD) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.
You must follow the policies and procedures specified in applicable sections of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by this part.

In addition to the four instances identified in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.425, you as a DoD Component official must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you obligate additional funding (e.g., through an incremental funding action) for a pre-existing grant or cooperative agreement with an institution of higher education, as provided in 32 CFR 22.520(e)(5).
You as a DoD Component official must include a term or condition in each covered transaction into which you enter, to communicate to the participant the requirements to&#8212;
