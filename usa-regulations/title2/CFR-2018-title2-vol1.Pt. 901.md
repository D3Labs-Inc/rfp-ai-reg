 Grants and Agreements. PART 901â€”NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION


# ID

 CFR-2018-title2-vol1.Pt. 901


# Summary

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the DOE policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.
The Director, Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, DOE, for DOE actions, and the Director, Office of Acquisition and Supply Management, NNSA, for NNSA actions, may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction.
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), DOE does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.
Debarring official (Department of Energy supplement to government-wide definition at 2 CFR 180.930).
The Debarring Official for the Department of Energy, exclusive of NNSA, is the Director, Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, DOE.
Suspending official (Department of Energy supplement to government-wide definition at 2 CFR 180.1010).
The suspending official for the Department of Energy, exclusive of NNSA, is the Director, Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, DOE.
