# Title

 Grants and Agreements. PART 3185â€”NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION


# ID

 CFR-2018-title2-vol1.Pt. 3185


# Summary

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.
This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, &#8220;Debarment and Suspension&#8221; (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p.
The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., &#167;&#8201;3185.220).
Who in the IMLS may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
The IMLS Director has the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower-tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), IMLS does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.
