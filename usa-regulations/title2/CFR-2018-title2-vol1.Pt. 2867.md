# ID

 CFR-2018-title2-vol1.Pt. 2867


# Summary

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Department of Justice policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.
This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, &#8220;Debarment and Suspension&#8221; (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p.
Within the Department of Justice, the Attorney General or designee has the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), the Department of Justice does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.
To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, the communication must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
