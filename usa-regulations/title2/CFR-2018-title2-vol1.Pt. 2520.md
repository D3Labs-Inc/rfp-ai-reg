# Title

 Grants and Agreements. PART 2520â€”NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION


# ID

 CFR-2018-title2-vol1.Pt. 2520


# Summary

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the NSF policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.
This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, &#8220;Debarment and Suspension&#8221; (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p.
The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., &#167;&#8201;2520.220).
The NSF Director and the Deputy Director have the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction.
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), NSF does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?
