# Summary

This part adopts the OMB guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by this part, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.
(a) Each USDA awarding agency must establish conflict of interest policies for its Federal awards.
(1) The non-Federal entity must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the performance of its employees in the selection, award and administration of Federal awards.
No employee, officer or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest.
Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a non-Federal entity considered for a Federal award.
(2) If the non-Federal entity has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the non-Federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest.
