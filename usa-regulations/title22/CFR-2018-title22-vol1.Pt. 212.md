|            |             (1) The Agency determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            |             (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |             (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or                                                                                                                                       |
|            |             (4) The designation made by the business submitter appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the Agency shall give the business submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date. |
