| (250.0, 'USD')     | (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| (250.0, 'USD')     | Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (100000.0, 'USD')  | (f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency.                                   |
| (5000.0, 'USD')    | (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater.                                                  |
| (5000.0, 'USD')    | For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| (500.0, 'USD')     | However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| (5000.0, 'USD')    | If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either cases, compensate the Federal Government for its share. |
| (25000.0, 'USD')   | (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| (100000.0, 'USD')  | (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000.                                                                        |
| (100000.0, 'USD')  | For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected.                                                                                                                                         |
| (1000000.0, 'USD') | The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (25000.0, 'USD')   | (v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                    |               (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                    |               (B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
