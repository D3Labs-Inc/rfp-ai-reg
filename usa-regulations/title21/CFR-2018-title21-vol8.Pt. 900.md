| 2018-05-02 | Values not shown in table 2 may be determined by linear interpolation or extrapolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2002-10-28 | After October 28, 2002, the system, under the same measuring conditions shall be capable of producing a minimum output of 7.0 mGy air kerma per second (800 mR per second) when operating at 28 kVp in the standard (moly/moly) mammography mode at any SID where the system is designed to operate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1999-04-28 | The facility's first audit analysis shall be initiated no later than 12 months after the date the facility becomes certified, or 12 months after April 28, 1999, whichever date is the latest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
