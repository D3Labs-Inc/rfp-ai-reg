|            |             (1) The quantity prescribed and dispensed is limited to the amount adequate to treat the patient during the emergency period (dispensing beyond the emergency period must be pursuant to a paper or electronic prescription signed by the prescribing individual practitioner);                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |             (2) The prescription shall be immediately reduced to writing by the pharmacist and shall contain all information required in &#167;&#8201;1306.05, except for the signature of the prescribing individual practitioner;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |             (3) If the prescribing individual practitioner is not known to the pharmacist, he must make a reasonable effort to determine that the oral authorization came from a registered individual practitioner, which may include a callback to the prescribing individual practitioner using his phone number as listed in the telephone directory and/or other good faith efforts to insure his identity; and                                                                                     |

| 7.0 day    | The paper prescription may be delivered to the pharmacist in person or by mail, but if delivered by mail it must be postmarked within the 7-day period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 90.0 day   | (b)(1) An individual practitioner may issue multiple prescriptions authorizing the patient to receive a total of up to a 90-day supply of a Schedule II controlled substance provided the following conditions are met:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |             (i) Each separate prescription is issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            |             (ii) The individual practitioner provides written instructions on each prescription (other than the first prescription, if the prescribing practitioner intends for that prescription to be filled immediately) indicating the earliest date on which a pharmacy may fill each prescription;                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            |             (iii) The individual practitioner concludes that providing the patient with multiple prescriptions in this manner does not create an undue risk of diversion or abuse;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            |             (iv) The issuance of multiple prescriptions as described in this section is permissible under the applicable state laws; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
