| 120.0 day  | (a) During the 120-day period of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of an FCN, FDA will not disclose publicly any information in that FCN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 90.0 day   | For example, if FDA objects to a notification 90 days after the date of receipt, the agency would make available its objection at that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 120.0 day  | For the purpose of this section, FDA's review is completed when FDA has allowed 120 days to pass without objecting to the FCN or FDA has issued an objection letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 120.0 day  | (a) If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not object to an FCN within the 120-day period for FDA review, the FCN becomes effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 120.0 day  | (b) If an FCN is complete when received, the 120-day review period begins on the date FDA receives the FCN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 120.0 day  | If the manufacturer or supplier submits the missing information before FDA sends an FCN nonacceptance letter, the 120-day review period begins on the date of receipt of the missing information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 120.0 day  | (2) If FDA objects to an FCN within the 120-day period for FDA review, the FCN will not become effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 120.0 day  | (3) FDA may object to an FCN if any part of FDA's 120-day review occurs during a period when this program is not funded as required in section 409(h)(5) of the act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 100-01-01  | In accordance with section 409(c)(5)(C) of the Act, the following safety factors will be applied in determining whether the proposed use of a food additive will be safe: Except where evidence is submitted which justifies use of a different safety factor, a safety factor in applying animal experimentation data to man of 100 to 1, will be used; that is, a food additive for use by man will not be granted a tolerance that will exceed 1/100th of the maximum amount demonstrated to be without harm to experimental animals. |
| 1958-01-01 | The basis of such views may be either (1) scientific procedures or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food.General recognition of safety requires common knowledge throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the conditions of its intended use (see &#167;&#8201;170.3(i)).                         |
