| (18000.0, 'GBP') | (a) The maximum weight allowance of HHG that may be shipped or stored at Government expense is 18,000 pounds net weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| (2000.0, 'GBP')  | For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000 pound allowance is added to the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance to cover packing materials for the shipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000 pound allowance is added to the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance to cover packing materials for the shipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | In no case may a shipment weigh over 20,000 gross pounds (the 18,000 pounds net weight of the uncrated HHG plus the 2,000 pound allowance for packing materials).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (2000.0, 'GBP')  | In no case may a shipment weigh over 20,000 gross pounds (the 18,000 pounds net weight of the uncrated HHG plus the 2,000 pound allowance for packing materials).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | That is, if the net weight of the HHG plus the PBP&amp;E is less than 18,000 pounds, the agency should ship the items together and pay for the HHG shipment in one payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | What happens if the HHG shipment includes PBP&E, and it might exceed, or did exceed, the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | If the result is more than the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | (a) No, you will not be responsible for the shipping charges that result from a weight additive so long as the actual weight of your HHG without the additive does not exceed the 18,000 pound net weight allowance for relocation.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe). |
| (700.0, 'GBP')   | However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe). |
| (65.0, 'GBP')    | However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe). |
| (18765.0, 'GBP') | However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe). |
| (65.0, 'GBP')    | However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe). |
| (100, 'GBP')     | The charges for transporting HHG, and temporary storage are computed by multiplying the number of pounds shipped divided by 100 (within the 18,000 maximum limitation) by the applicable rate per one-hundred pounds for the distance transported.                                                                                                                                                         |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | Charges for HHG, PBP&amp;E and temporary storage are calculated based on the minimum weight charged by the carrier, but not to exceed 18,000 pounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | Any cost or weight in excess of 18,000 pounds will be at your expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | Is my UAB shipment in addition to the 18,000 pounds net weight of the HHG weight allowance?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | No, for all shipments made under the authority of the FTR, the UAB shipment is part of, not in addition to, the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (350.0, 'GBP')   | (a) Up to 350 pounds actual weight (including the weight of the luggage or packing material) for the employee and each immediate family member 12 years of age and over; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                  |                 (b) Up to 175 pounds actual weight (including the weight of the luggage or packing material) for each immediate family member under 12 years of age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (175.0, 'GBP')   | (a) Up to 350 pounds actual weight (including the weight of the luggage or packing material) for the employee and each immediate family member 12 years of age and over; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                  |                 (b) Up to 175 pounds actual weight (including the weight of the luggage or packing material) for each immediate family member under 12 years of age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (18000.0, 'GBP') | (3) If a PBP&amp;E shipment causes the weight of a shipment under the commuted rate method to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, then the actual cost of shipping that excess weight attributed to the PBP&amp;E may be paid as an administrative expense of the agency.                                                                                                               |
