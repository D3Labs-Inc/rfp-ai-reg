# Summary

(b) Pamphlets, charts, and other written data may be offered to the DOT decisionmaker at oral argument only in accordance with the following rules: All such material shall be limited to facts in the record of the case being argued and shall be served on all parties to the proceeding with four (4) copies transmitted to Department of Transportation Dockets at least five (5) calendar days in advance of the argument.
The Department, on its own initiative, or if it is of the opinion that the facts stated in a petition or complaint warrant it, may issue an order instituting an investigation of the lawfulness of any present or proposed rates, fares, or charges for the foreign air transportation of persons or property by aircraft or the lawfulness of any classification, rule, regulation, or practice affecting such rates, fares, or charges, and may assign the proceeding for hearing before an administrative law judge.
(b) If an answer raising a material issue of fact is filed within the time designated in the Department's order, the DOT decisionmaker may then issue an order authorizing additional pleadings and/or establishing further procedural steps, including setting the matter for oral evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.

| 2018-12-01 | In determining the merits of an appeal, the DOT decisionmaker will not consider the exceptions or the petition for discretionary review but will consider only the brief.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2018-12-01 | Each objection contained in the exceptions or each issue specified in the DOT decisionmaker's order exercising discretionary review must be restated and supported by a statement and adequate discussion of all matters relied upon, in a brief filed pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-12-01 | Each brief shall discuss every point of law, fact, or precedent that the party submitting it is entitled to raise and that it wishes the DOT decisionmaker to consider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-12-01 | If a brief or any point discussed in the brief is not in substantial conformity with the requirement for such support and justification, no motion to strike or dismiss such document shall be made but the DOT decisionmaker may disregard the points involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2018-12-01 | Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker shall be completely self-contained and shall not incorporate by reference any portion of any other brief or pleading; Provided, however, That instead of submitting a brief to the DOT decisionmaker a party may adopt by reference specifically identified pages or the whole of his or her prior brief to the administrative law judge if the latter complies with all requirements of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 2018-12-01 | In such cases, the party shall file with Department of Transportation Dockets a letter exercising this privilege and serve all parties in the same manner as a brief to the DOT decisionmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2018-12-01 | Except by permission or direction of the DOT decisionmaker, briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages including pages contained in any appendix, table, chart, or other document physically attached to the brief, but excluding maps and the summary of the argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 2018-12-01 | (a) Proceedings for the determination of rates of compensation for the transportation of mail may be commenced by the filing of a petition by an air carrier whose rate is to be fixed, or the U.S. Postal Service, or upon the issuance of an order by the DOT decisionmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2018-12-01 | (c) In any case where an air carrier is operating under a final mail rate uniformly applicable to an entire rate-making unit as established by the DOT decisionmaker, a petition must clearly and unequivocally challenge the rate for such entire rate-making unit and not only a part of such unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2018-12-01 | Whether the proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition or upon the Department's own initiative, the DOT decisionmaker may issue an order directing the respondent to show cause why it should not adopt such findings and conclusions and such final rates as may be specified in the order to show cause, or may issue an order setting the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 2018-12-01 | (a) If no answer is filed within the designated time, or if a timely filed answer raises no material issue of fact, the DOT decisionmaker may, upon the basis of the record in the proceeding, enter a final order fixing the rate or rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2018-12-01 | (b) If an answer raising a material issue of fact is filed within the time designated in the Department's order, the DOT decisionmaker may then issue an order authorizing additional pleadings and/or establishing further procedural steps, including setting the matter for oral evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-12-01 | (b)(1) The parties to the proceeding shall be the air carrier or carriers for whom rates are to be fixed, the U.S. Postal Service, the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings and any other person whom the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge permits to intervene in accordance with &#167;&#8201;302.20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2018-12-01 | (c) All direct evidence shall be in writing and shall be filed in exhibit form within the times specified by the DOT decisionmaker or by the administrative law judge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2018-12-01 | At any time during the pendency of a proceeding for the determination of final mail rates, the DOT decisionmaker, upon his or her own initiative, or on petition by the air carrier whose rates are in issue or by the U.S. Postal Service, may fix temporary rates of compensation for the transportation of mail subject to downward or upward adjustment upon the determination of final mail rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-12-01 | The employees' function in both instances is to present clearly to the DOT decisionmaker the issues and the related material facts, together with recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2018-12-01 | The DOT decisionmaker will make an independent determination of the soundness of the employees's analyses and recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
