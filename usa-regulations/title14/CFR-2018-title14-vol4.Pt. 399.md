 Aeronautics and Space. PART 399â€”STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY


# ID

 CFR-2018-title14-vol4.Pt. 399


# Summary

For intra-Hawaii markets, the Board's flexibility zones are based not on the SIFL, but on the standard Hawaiian fare level (&#8220;SHFL&#8221;), which is equal to 110 percent of the first class fare in effect on July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.
This section sets forth the Board's policy on passenger fares for scheduled service by certificated air carriers in the following areas, except to the extent that greater flexibility is set forth in &#167;&#8201;399.33:
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will not suspend as unreasonable any proposed rate for foreign air transportation of property equal to or less than the following levels:
For rate-making purposes, for air carriers receiving subsidy under section 406 of the Act, it is the policy of the Board that flight equipment depreciation will be based on the conventional straight-line method of accrual, employing the service lives and residual values set forth below:
This policy shall apply to proceedings in which the Board, in exercising its regulatory powers with respect to air carriers and foreign air carriers, is required to determine whether carriers have engaged in unfair or deceptive practices, or unfair methods of competition.

| 20.0 day    | (2) In the case of petitions for review or for reconsideration, notices of target dates shall be issued, served, and filed within 20 days of the date for the filing of answers: Provided, That, in the case of petitions for reconsideration of Board decisions awarding new route authority, the Board shall, in lieu of issuing individual target dates, endeavor to render its decision no later than the day preceding the effective date of the new authority awarded.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30.0 minute | (2) For the purposes of this section, a chronically delayed flight means any domestic flight that is operated at least 10 times a month, and arrives more than 30 minutes late (including cancelled flights) more than 50 percent of the time during that month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 30.0 minute | (3) For purposes of this paragraph, the Department considers all of a carrier's flights that are operated in a given city-pair market whose scheduled departure times are within 30 minutes of the most frequently occurring scheduled departure time to be one single flight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1 month     | (4) The holding out of a chronically delayed flight for more than four consecutive one-month periods represents one form of unrealistic scheduling and is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1 second    | (a) If a U. S. or foreign air carrier has a website accessible for ticket purchases by the general public in the U.S., the carrier must promptly and prominently disclose any increase in its fee for carry-on or first and second checked bags and any change in the first and second checked bags or carry-on allowance for a passenger on the homepage of that website (e.g., provide a link that says &#8220;changed bag rules&#8221; or similarly descriptive language and takes the consumer from the homepage directly to a pop-up or a place on another webpage that details the change in baggage allowance or fees and the effective dates of such changes). |

| 1977-07-01 | DPFI formula fare means the trunk coach formula fare on July 1, 1977, as established by the Board in Phase 9 of the Domestic Passenger Fares Investigation (Docket 21866-9).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1977-07-01 | Except as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the standard industry fare level (&#8220;SIFL&#8221;) for coach/standard service in a market is equal to the predominant fare in effect in that market on July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1977-07-01 | For each market, the predominant fare in effect on July 1, 1977, is presumed to be as set forth below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1977-07-01 | (1) For U.S. Mainland-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands markets where the Board has specified day-of-week fare differentials: the peak-season midweek fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1977-07-01 | (2) For U.S. Mainland-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands markets where the Board has specified only seasonal fare differentials: the off-peak-season fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1977-07-01 | (3) For U.S. Mainland-Hawaii markets: the peak-season second class fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1977-07-01 | (4) For all other interstate and overseas markets: the lowest unrestricted fare in effect on July 1, 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1977-07-01 | For each of these markets, the SIFL is equal to the level that it would be if the market were an interstate one whose predominant fare on July 1, 1977, was the DPFI formula fare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1977-07-01 | For intra-Hawaii markets, the Board's flexibility zones are based not on the SIFL, but on the standard Hawaiian fare level (&#8220;SHFL&#8221;), which is equal to 110 percent of the first class fare in effect on July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-03-01 | Each carrier may set fares above the SIFL as follows, and where they are so set, the Board will not suspend them on the grounds that their level is unreasonable except upon a clear showing of abuse of market power that the Board does not expect to be corrected through marketplace forces:                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1981-01-13 | Each time after January 13, 1981, that the Board adjusts the SIFL for cost increases in accordance with &#167;&#8201;399.31(c), it will adjust the $14 figure by the same percentage rounded to the nearest whole dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2018-03-01 | The Board will not suspend such a fare on the ground that its level is unreasonable except upon a clear showing of abuse of market power that the Board does not expect to be corrected through marketplace forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1983-01-01 | Tariffs for domestic air transportation on or after January 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1983-01-01 | The Board will not approve or accept any tariff filings for interstate of overseas air transportation to be performed on or after January 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1982-12-31 | Any tariffs for such transportation that do not specify an earlier expiration date shall expire at midnight on December 31, 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1982-04-01 | For each market in foreign air transportation, the standard foreign rate level for the carriage of property shall be the bulk general commodity rates in effect in that market on April 1, 1982, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-04-01 | (4) Adjustments will be made on April 1 and October 1 of each year, or more frequently as the Board finds appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
