# Title

 Aeronautics and Space. PART 244â€”REPORTING TARMAC DELAY DATA


# ID

 CFR-2018-title14-vol4.Pt. 244


# Summary

Also, for purposes of section 244.3 carriers using a Docking Guidance System (DGS) may record the official &#8220;gate-arrival time&#8221; when the aircraft is stopped at the appropriate parking mark.
If passengers were boarded without the parking brake being set, the reportable gate departure time is the time that the last passenger door was closed.
Covered carriers must report all passenger operations that experience a tarmac time of more than 3 hours at a U.S. airport.
These carriers that are covered by part 234 need only submit information for flights with tarmac delays of more than 3 hours under this part 244 for domestic scheduled passenger flights to or from any U.S. medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport to the extent they do not report such information under 14 CFR 234.7.
(a) Each covered carrier shall file BTS Form 244 &#8220;Tarmac Delay Report&#8221; with the Office of Airline Information of the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics setting forth the information for each of its covered flights that experienced a tarmac delay of more than 3 hours, including diverted flights and cancelled flights on which the passengers were boarded and then deplaned before the cancellation.
