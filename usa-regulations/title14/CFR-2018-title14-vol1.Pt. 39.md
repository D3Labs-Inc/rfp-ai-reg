# Title

 Aeronautics and Space. PART 39â€”AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES


# ID

 CFR-2018-title14-vol1.Pt. 39


# Summary

The regulations in this part provide a legal framework for FAA's system of Airworthiness Directives.
FAA's airworthiness directives are legally enforceable rules that apply to the following products: aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances.
FAA issues an airworthiness directive addressing a product when we find that:
What if I operate an aircraft or use a product that does not meet the requirements of an airworthiness directive?
If the requirements of an airworthiness directive have not been met, you violate &#167;&#8201;39.7 each time you operate the aircraft or use the product.
Does an airworthiness directive apply if the product has been changed?
What must I do if a change in a product affects my ability to accomplish the actions required in an airworthiness directive?
If a change in a product affects your ability to accomplish the actions required by the airworthiness directive in any way, you must request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance.
The principal inspector may add comments and will send your request to the manager of the office identified in the airworthiness directive (manager).
Each airworthiness directive identifies the office responsible for approving alternative methods of compliance.
