 Aeronautics and Space. PART 29â€”AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY ROTORCRAFT


# ID

 CFR-2018-title14-vol1.Pt. 29


# Summary

(b) For multiengine Category B rotorcraft meeting the Category A engine isolation requirements, the steady rate of climb (or descent) must be determined at the speed for best rate of climb (or minimum rate of descent) at each altitude, temperature, and weight at which the rotorcraft is expected to operate, with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at maximum continuous power including continuous OEI power, if approved, and at 30-minute OEI power for rotorcraft for which certification for the use of 30-minute OEI power is requested.
(1) In-flight measurements to determine the fatigue loads or stresses for the PSEs identified in paragraph (d) of this section in all critical conditions throughout the range of design limitations required by &#167;&#8201;29.309 (including altitude effects), except that maneuvering load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in operations.
(2) Each turbine engine must idle for 30 minutes on the ground, with the air bleed available for engine icing protection at its critical condition, without adverse effect, in an atmosphere that is at a temperature between 15&#176; and 30 &#176;F (between &#8722;9&#176; and &#8722;1 &#176;C) and has a liquid water content not less than 0.3 grams per cubic meter in the form of drops having a mean effective diameter not less than 20 microns, followed by momentary operation at takeoff power or thrust.
