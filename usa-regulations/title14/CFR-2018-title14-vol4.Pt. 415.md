# Summary

Once licensed, a launch operator must perform a flight safety analysis for each launch using final launch vehicle performance and other data as required by subpart C of part 417 of this chapter and using the analysis methods approved by the FAA through the licensing process.
An applicant's safety review document must include a ground safety analysis report, and a ground safety plan for its launch processing and post-flight operations as required by this section, &#167;&#8201;417.109 of this chapter, and subpart E of part 417 of this chapter when launching from a launch point in the United States.
(a) An applicant's safety review document must describe all computing systems and software that perform a safety-critical computer system function for any operation performed during launch processing or flight that could have a hazardous effect on the public as required by &#167;&#8201;417.123 of this chapter.
An applicant's safety review document must contain a list of the flight termination system installation procedures and a synopsis of the procedures that demonstrates how each of those procedures meet the requirements of section D417.15 of appendix D of part 417 of this chapter.
