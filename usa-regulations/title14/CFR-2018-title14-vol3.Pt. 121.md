| 100.0 hour   | The requirement for at least 100 hours of proving tests may be reduced by the Administrator if the Administrator determines that a satisfactory level of proficiency has been demonstrated to justify the reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 100.0 hour   | (b) The 100 hours of pilot in command experience required by paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced (not to exceed 50 percent) by substituting one landing in operations under this part in the type of airplane for 1 required hour of pilot in command experience, if the pilot has at least 100 hours as pilot in command of another type airplane in operations under this part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
