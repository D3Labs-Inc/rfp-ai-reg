| 30.0 day   | Under &#167;&#8201;1245.104, advance waiver of any or all of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions which may be made under a contract may be requested prior to the execution of the contract, or within 30 days after execution of the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30.0 day   | (b) The NASA Inventions and Contributions Board normally will recommend grant of a request for advance waiver of domestic rights submitted prior to execution of contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract unless the Board finds that the interests of the United States will be better served by restricting or denying all or part of the requested rights in one or more of the following situations:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |                     (1) When the contractor is not located in the United States or does not have a place of business in the United States or is subject to the control of a foreign government;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6.0 month  | (3) An advance waiver, when granted, will apply only to inventions reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and a designation made within 6 months of the time of reporting (or a reasonable time thereafter permitted for good cause shown) that the contractor elects title to the invention and intends to file or has filed a U.S. patent application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8.0 month  | (b)(1) When an individual identified invention has been reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and waiver of rights has not been granted under &#167;&#8201;1245.104, the Board normally will recommend grant of a request for waiver of domestic rights to such invention if the request is received within 8 months of first disclosure to NASA (or such longer period that the Board may permit for good cause shown), unless the Board finds that one or more of the situations set forth in &#167;&#8201;1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v) exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day   | (c) Before revocation or modification of the license, the contractor will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the contractor will be allowed 30 days (or any other time as may be allowed by the Administrator for good cause shown by the contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
