# Title

 Aeronautics and Space. PART 1274â€”COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH COMMERCIAL FIRMS


# ID

 CFR-2018-title14-vol5.Pt. 1274


# Summary

While the principal purpose of NASA's involvement and commitment of resources is to stimulate or support research activity, a major incentive for involvement by commercial firms (particularly where costs are shared) is the profit potential from marketable products expected to result from the cooperative agreement project.
(1) At a minimum, the selection process for the competitive award of cooperative agreements to commercial entities shall include evaluation of potential recipients' proposals for merit and relevance to NASA's mission requirements through their responses to the publication of NASA evaluation factors.
(2) During evaluation of the cost proposal, the agreement officer, along with other NASA evaluation team members and/or pricing support personnel, shall determine the reasonableness of the overall proposed project costs, including verifying the value of the recipient's proposed non-cash and in-kind contributions.
(i) If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any period during the period of performance of this Federal award, then you as the recipient during that period of time must maintain the currency of information reported in FAPIIS about civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

| 90.0 day   | For many projects, scheduling milestones to be accomplished about every 60 to 90 days appears to be most workable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3 year     | (a) Multiple year cooperative agreements are encouraged, but normally they should span no more than three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5.0 year   | (b) Cooperative agreements that will exceed $5 million and have a period of performance in excess of 5 years shall require the approval of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement prior to award.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5.0 year   | Requests for approval shall include a justification for exceeding 5 years and evidence that the extended years can be reasonably priced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5.0 year   | Requests for approval are not required when the 5-year limitation is exceeded due to a no cost extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.0 year   | (d) The provisions set forth in &#167;&#8201;1274.901 are generally considered appropriate for agreements not exceeding 3 years and/or a Government cash contribution not exceeding $20M.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.0 year   | For cooperative agreements expected to be longer than 3 years and/or involve Government cash contributions exceeding $20M, consideration should be given to provisions which place additional restrictions on the recipient in terms of validating performance and accounting for funds expended.                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day   | Such a request may be made in advance of the agreement (or 30 days thereafter) for all inventions made under the agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 60.0 day   | (3) Once a recipient has exercised its option to apply for an exclusive or partially exclusive license, a notice, identifying the invention and the recipient, is published in the Federal Register, providing the public opportunity for filing written objections for 60 days.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5 year     | Therefore, a reasonable time period (i.e., depending on the technology, two to five years after production of the data) may be established after which the data first produced by the recipient in the performance of the agreement will be made public.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5 year     | (7) In accordance with section 303(b) of the Space Act, any data first produced by NASA under the agreement which embodies trade secrets or financial information that would be privileged or confidential if it had been obtained from a private participant, will be marked with an appropriate legend and maintained in confidence for an agreed to period of up to five years (the maximum allowed by law).                               |
| 6 month    | The attendance rosters and certificates shall be maintained in official files for a minimum of six months after award.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
