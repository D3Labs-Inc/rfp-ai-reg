# Title

 Aeronautics and Space. PART 95â€”IFR ALTITUDES


# ID

 CFR-2018-title14-vol2.Pt. 95


# Summary

(a) This part prescribes altitudes governing the operation of aircraft under IFR on ATS routes, or other direct routes for which an MEA is designated in this part.
In addition, it designates mountainous areas and changeover points.
(b) The MAA is the highest altitude on an ATS route, or other direct route for which an MEA is designated, at which adequate reception of VOR signals is assured.
Unless otherwise specified, an MEA prescribed for an off airway route or route segment applies to the airspace 4 nautical miles on each side of a direct course between the navigation fixes defining that route or route segment.
(g) The changeover point (COP) applies to operation of an aircraft along a Federal airway, jet route, or other direct route; for which an MEA is designated in this part.
Eastern United States Mountainous Area.
Western United States Mountainous Area.
All of the following area excluding those portions specified in the exceptions:
All of the following area excluding those portions specified in the exceptions:
All of the following area excluding those portions specified in the exceptions:
This subpart prescribes COP's for Federal airways, jet routes, area navigation routes, or other direct routes for which an MEA is designated in this part.
