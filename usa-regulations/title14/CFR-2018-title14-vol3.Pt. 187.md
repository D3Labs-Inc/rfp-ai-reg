Overflight through Enroute airspace means an overflight through U.S.-controlled airspace where primarily radar-based air traffic services are provided.
Overflight through Oceanic airspace means an overflight through U.S.-controlled airspace where primarily procedural air traffic services are provided.
(b) Applicants for the FAA services provided under this part shall pay any bank processing charges on fees collected under this part, when such charges are assessed on U.S. Government.
(c) Applicants for the FAA services described in Appendix A of this part shall pay bank processing charges, when such charges are assessed by banks on U.S. Government deposits.
