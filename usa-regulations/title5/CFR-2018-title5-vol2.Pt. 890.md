| 1999-01-01 | (b) In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8906(a) which take effect with the contract year that begins in January 1999, OPM will determine the amounts representing the weighted average of subscription charges in effect for each contract year, for self only, self plus one, and self and family enrollments, as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (1) The determination of the weighted average of subscription charges will only include those health benefits plans which are continuing FEHB Program participation from one contract year to the next.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2018-09-01 | (i) If OPM and the carrier for a plan that will continue participation have closed negotiations on rates for the upcoming contract year by September 1 of the current contract year, i.e., the determination year, OPM will use the plan's negotiated subscription charges for the upcoming contract year in the determination of the weighted average of subscription charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2018-09-01 | (ii) If OPM and the carrier for a plan that applied to continue participation have not closed rate negotiations for the upcoming contract year by September 1 of the determination year, OPM will make a deemed adjustment to such plan's subscription charges for the current contract year for purposes of counting eligible enrollees of the plan in the determination of weighted average charges for the upcoming contract year.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2018-09-01 | The deemed adjustment will equal any increase or decrease OPM finds in its determination of the weighted average of subscription charges for the upcoming contract year for all plans with which OPM has closed rates on September 1 of the determination year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2018-09-01 | (iii) There will be no subsequent adjustment in the weighted average charges applicable to the upcoming contract year to reflect rate negotiations closed after September 1 of the determination year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-03-31 | (ii) When a comprehensive medical plan (CMP) varies subscription charges for different portions of the plan's service area and the plan's contract for the upcoming contract year will reconfigure geographic areas associated with subscription charges, so that there will not be a direct correlation between enrollment in the determination year and rating areas for the upcoming contract year, OPM will estimate what portion of the plan's enrollees on March 31 of the determination year will be subject to each of the plan's subscription rates for the upcoming contract year. |
