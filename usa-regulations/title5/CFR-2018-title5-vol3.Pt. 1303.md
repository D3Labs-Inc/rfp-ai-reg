| 3 hour     | With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, OMB will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2 hour     | When the cost of search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, OMB will begin assessing charges for computer search.                                          |
| 2 hour     | Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3 hour     | OMB shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.     |
| 30 day     | The fact that the fee has been received by OMB within the thirty day grace period, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
