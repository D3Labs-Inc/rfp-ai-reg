|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 20.0 day   | Whenever the Board cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of &#8220;unusual circumstances,&#8221; as defined in the FOIA, and the Board extends the time limit on that basis, the Board must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Board estimates processing of the request will be completed.         |
| 90.0 day   | (5) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Executive Director within 90 calendar days of receipt of the denial or partial denial, that the requestor has the option to contact the Agency's FOIA Liaison at frtibfoialiaison@tsp.gov, and that the requestor has the option to contact the Office of Government Information Service (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.                                                    |
| 90.0 day   | The appeal must be made in writing and for it to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days of receipt of the denial or partial denial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2 hour     | Commercial users are not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3 hour     | (4) For any request which does not meet the criteria contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge.                                                                                                                     |
| 3 hour     | If computer search time is required, the first two hours of computer search time will be based on the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 23.5 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2 hour     | When the cost of the computer search, including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process the request, equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, the Board shall begin assessing charges for computer search.                                                                                                                                   |
| 3 hour     | (b) Except for requests that are for a commercial use, the Board may not charge for the first two hours of search time or for the first 100 pages of reproduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30.0 day   | For example, it would be reasonable to presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period had been made to avoid fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3 hour     | (3) For all other requests not falling within the category of commercial use requests, representatives of news media, or educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, if the direct cost of searching for and duplicating the records sought, excluding the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages which are free of charge, would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.                            |
| 10.0 day   | (1) If the Board determines that &#8220;unusual circumstances,&#8221; as defined in the FOIA, apply and the Board provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with &#167;&#8201;1631.8, the Board is excused for an additional 10 days from the restrictions of this section.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 30.0 day   | (b) When a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 calendar days of the date of the billing), the Board may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided in &#167;&#8201;1631.14(d), and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester. |
| 30.0 day   | Commencing January 1, 1988, the submitter of confidential commercial information must, at the time the information is submitted to the Board or within 30 calendar days of such submission, designate any information the disclosure of which the submitter claims could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.                                                                                                                  |
| 10.0 day   | (6) Should the Board determine to disclose the requested records, it shall provide written notice to the submitter, explaining briefly why the submitter's objections were not sustained and setting forth the date for disclosure, which date may be less than 10 calendar days after the date of the letter to the submitter.                                                                                                                         |
