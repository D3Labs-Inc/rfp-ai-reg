| 30.0 day   | (1) The TSP will not calculate breakage if contributions or loan payments are posted within 30 days of the &#8220;as of&#8221; date, or if the total amount on a late payment record or the total agency contributions on a current payment record is less than $1.00; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |             (2) The TSP will not take the participant's interfund transfers into account when determining breakage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30.0 day   | Within 30 days of receiving information from his or her employing agency indicating that the employing agency acknowledges that an error has occurred which has caused a smaller amount of employee contributions to be made to the participant's account than should have been made, a participant may elect to establish a schedule to make up the deficient contributions through future payroll deductions.                                                                                   |
| 6 month    | An employee is not eligible to make up contributions with an &#8220;as of&#8221; date occurring during a period of six months following a financial hardship in-service withdrawal, as provided in 5 CFR 1650.33.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30.0 day   | Within 30 days of receiving the employing agency's acknowledgment of the error, a uniformed service member may establish a schedule of makeup contributions with his or her employing agency to replace the missed contribution through future payroll deductions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8.0 month  | For example, a uniformed service member who earns $29,000 yearly in basic pay and who missed a $2,500 bonus contribution to the TSP can establish a schedule of makeup contributions with a maximum duration of 8 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2.0 month  | This is because it takes the uniformed service member 2 months to earn $2,500 in basic pay (at $2,416.67 per month).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1 year     | (2) Erroneous employer contributions will be returned to the employing agency only if the negative adjustment record is posted by the TSP record keeper within one year of the date the erroneous contribution was posted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1 year     | If one year or more has elapsed when the negative adjustment record is posted, the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |             (3) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to or greater than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the full amount of the erroneous contribution.                                                                                                                                   |
| 1 year     | If one year or more has elapsed when the negative adjustment record is posted, the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |             (3) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to or greater than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the full amount of the erroneous contribution.                                                                                                                                   |
| 1 year     | Any earnings attributable to the erroneous contribution will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|            |             (4) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted, and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is less than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the amount of the erroneous contribution reduced by the investment loss; and                                                                                                                   |
|            |             (5) An employing agency's obligation to submit negative adjustment records to remove erroneous contributions from a participant's account is not affected by the length of time the contributions have been in the account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1 day      | The contribution election will be effective as soon as administratively feasible, but no later than the first day of the first full pay period after it is received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 90.0 day   | The right to restore the withdrawn funds will expire if the participant does not notify the Board within 90 days of reinstatement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1 year     | An employing agency may submit a negative adjustment record to request the return of an erroneous contribution that has been in the participant's account for less than one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1 year     | An employing service may submit a negative adjustment record to request the return of an erroneous contribution that has been in the participant's account for less than one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 30.0 day   | (c) All contributions or loan payments on payment records contained in a payroll submission that was received from an employing agency more than 30 days after the pay date associated with the payroll submission (as reported on the appropriate journal voucher), will be subject to breakage calculated, posted, and charged to the employing agency (or forfeited to the TSP) in accordance with &#167;&#8201;1605.2.                                                                        |
| 6 month    | (1) Upon discovery of an error made within the past six months involving the correct or timely remittance of payments to the TSP (other than a retirement system misclassification error, as covered in paragraph (c) of this section), an employing agency must promptly correct the error on its own initiative.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6 month    | If the error was made more than six months before it was discovered, the agency may exercise sound discretion in deciding whether to correct it, but, in any event, the agency must act promptly in doing so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
