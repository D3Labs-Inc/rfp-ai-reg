| 3 hour     | (4) The Authority, the General Counsel, the Panel, or the IG shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories of this section fees that recover the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.                                                                                                                                                             |

| 30.0 day   | If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the fee determination, the request will be closed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
