| 30.0 day    | This section applies only when an employee must perform work or duties that are not consistent with the employee's primary duties for an extended period, that is, for more than 30 consecutive calendar days&#8212;the &#8220;30-day test.&#8221; The period of performing different work or duties may or may not involve a different geographic duty location.                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day    | (1) Assess an employee's temporary work or duties over a reasonable period of time (the 30-day test), compare them with the primary duties upon which the employee's exemption status is based, and determine the employee's exemption status as described in &#167;&#167;&#8201;551.203 through 551.210; and                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|             |               (2) Ensure that it does not avoid reassessing, and perhaps changing, an employee's exemption status by breaking up periods of temporary work or duties with periods of having the employee perform his or her regular work or duties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3 day       | For example, an agency may not assign exempt employees to perform nonexempt work or duties for 29 consecutive calendar days, return them to their exempt duties for two or three days, then assign them again to perform nonexempt work for another 29 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 29.0 day    | For example, an agency may not assign exempt employees to perform nonexempt work or duties for 29 consecutive calendar days, return them to their exempt duties for two or three days, then assign them again to perform nonexempt work for another 29 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30.0 day    | (c) Aggregation of more than 30 nonconsecutive calendar days over an extended period does not meet the 30-day test and may not be used to change an employee's exemption status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4.0 day     | For example, if an exempt employee performs nonexempt duties 4 days in one week, 2 days in the following week, and so on over a period of weeks or months, the days of nonexempt work may not be aggregated for the purpose of changing the employee's exemption status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1 week      | For example, if an exempt employee performs nonexempt duties 4 days in one week, 2 days in the following week, and so on over a period of weeks or months, the days of nonexempt work may not be aggregated for the purpose of changing the employee's exemption status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2.0 day     | For example, if an exempt employee performs nonexempt duties 4 days in one week, 2 days in the following week, and so on over a period of weeks or months, the days of nonexempt work may not be aggregated for the purpose of changing the employee's exemption status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30.0 day    | (2) If a nonexempt employee becomes exempt under the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|             |               (i) The employee must be considered exempt for the entire period of temporary work or duties; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|             |               (ii) If the employee received FLSA overtime pay for work performed during the first 30 calendar days of the temporary work or duties, the agency must recalculate the employee's total pay retroactive to the beginning of that period because the employee is no longer entitled to the FLSA overtime pay received but may be owed title 5 overtime pay, or its equivalent.                                                                                                                    |
