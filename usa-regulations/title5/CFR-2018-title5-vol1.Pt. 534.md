|            |               (ii) A pay increase is necessary to reassign a senior executive to a position with substantially greater scope and responsibility or to recruit a senior executive with superior leadership or other competencies from a position in another agency;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |               (iii) The retention of the senior executive is critical to the mission of the agency and the senior executive would be likely to leave the agency in the absence of a pay increase; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (iv) Such action conforms to an otherwise applicable executive appraisal and pay adjustment cycle (e.g., in the case of a senior executive who was appointed to an SES position within the past 12 months or a senior executive who was transferred to an SES position from an agency with a different senior executive appraisal and pay adjustment cycle within the past 12 months).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12.0 month | Any pay adjustment made as a result of a determination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying &#167;&#8201;534.404(c) and begins a new 12-month period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1 day      | An authorized agency official may adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay converted under &#167;&#8201;534.406 on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, or on any date thereafter prior to obtaining certification under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, but only up to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12.0 month | The authorized agency official may provide an increase in pay if warranted under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and the senior executive is otherwise eligible for such an increase (i.e., he or she did not receive a pay adjustment under &#167;&#8201;534.404(c) during the previous 12-month period).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12.0 month | The authorized agency official may provide an increase in pay if warranted under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and if the senior executive is otherwise eligible for such an increase (i.e., he or she did not receive a pay adjustment under &#167;&#8201;534.404(c) during the previous 12-month period).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1 day      | (1) If there is an additional increase in the rates for the Executive Schedule in a calendar year, and if that increase becomes effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1 (i.e., the date prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 5318), an agency may review any previous determination to adjust the pay of a senior executive that was made effective on or after the effective date of the first increase in the rates for the Executive Schedule to determine whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be warranted for senior executives based on the same criteria used for the previous determination.                                                                         |
| 1 day      | The determination to provide an additional pay increase must be approved and made effective as of the effective date of increases in the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318 (i.e., the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|            |               (4) The administrative and management controls that will be applied to ensure compliance with applicable statutes, OPM's regulations, the agency's plan, and, where applicable, the certification requirements set forth in 5 CFR 430, subpart D, and the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in &#167;&#8201;534.403(a).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12.0 month | (1) An authorized agency official may set the pay of a senior executive transferring from another agency at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in &#167;&#8201;534.403(a) and the restrictions on reducing the pay of career senior executives in paragraph (h)(2) of this section (upon transfer to an agency whose applicable performance appraisal system is not certified) and in &#167;&#8201;534.406(b) (for 12 months following the effective date of the new SES pay system).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
