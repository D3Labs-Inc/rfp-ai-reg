| 30.0 day   | The TSP annuity vendor will make the first annuity payment approximately 30 days after the TSP purchases the annuity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 10.0 year  | This feature provides that, if the participant dies before annuity payments have been made for 10 years (120 payments), monthly payments will be made to the beneficiary(ies) until 120 payments have been made.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31.0 day   | Upon receiving information from the employing agency that a participant has been separated for more than 31 days and that any outstanding loans have been closed, the TSP record keeper will distribute the entire amount of his or her account balance if the account balance is $5.00 or more but less than $200.                                                                                                         |
| 5.0 year   | (c) If a withdrawal includes an amount from a participant's Roth balance and the participant elects to transfer that amount to another eligible employer plan or Roth IRA, the TSP will inform the plan administrator or trustee of the start date of the participant's Roth 5 year non-exclusion period or the participant's Roth initiation date, and the portion of the distribution that represents Roth contributions. |
| 6 month    | (b) A participant who obtains a financial hardship in-service withdrawal may not contribute to the TSP for a period of six months after the withdrawal is processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6 month    | Therefore, the participant's employing agency will discontinue his or her contributions (and any applicable Agency Matching Contributions) for six months after the agency is notified by the TSP; in the case of a FERS or BRS participant, Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions will continue.                                                                                                                             |
| 6 month    | A participant whose TSP contributions are discontinued by his or her agency after a financial hardship withdrawal can resume contributions any time after expiration of the six-month period by submitting a new TSP contribution election.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6 month    | (b) There is no limit on the number of financial hardship withdrawals a participant can make; however, the TSP will not accept a financial hardship withdrawal request for a period of six months after a financial hardship disbursement is made.                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 90.0 day   | (1) To show that the spouse has waived the right to this annuity, the participant must submit to the TSP record keeper a properly completed withdrawal request form, signed by his or her spouse in the presence of a notary, unless the TSP granted the participant an exception under this subpart to the spousal notification requirement within 90 days of the date the withdrawal form is processed by the TSP.        |
