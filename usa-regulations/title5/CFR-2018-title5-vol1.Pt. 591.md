| 2018-12-01 | OPM computes expenditure weights by dividing each DEC or aggregate by the total expenditure derived from the DC expenditure computed in step 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-12-01 | For each DEC represented by one or more items for which OPM could make valid price comparisons (e.g., OPM was able to collect representative prices in both the COLA and DC areas), OPM computes the unweighted geometric average (the nth root of the product of n numbers) of the price index(es) of all item(s) representing the DEC.                                                                                                                  |
| 2018-12-01 | OPM multiplies the price index for each DEC by its expenditure weight, sums the cross products, and divides by the sum of the weights used in the calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
