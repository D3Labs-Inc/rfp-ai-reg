| (25.0, 'USD')  | Making a FOIA request shall be considered an agreement by the requester to pay all applicable fees chargeable under &#167;&#8201;1820.7, up to and including the amount of $25.00, unless the requester asks for a waiver of fees or specifies a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.                                                                                                         |
| (5.5, 'USD')   | (ii) For each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested record, the fee will be $5.50.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (9.0, 'USD')   | Where a search and retrieval cannot be performed entirely by clerical personnel - for example, where the identification of records within the scope of a request requires the use of professional personnel - the fee will be $9.00 for each quarter hour of search time spent by professional personnel.                                                                                               |
| (17.5, 'USD')  | Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee will be $17.50 for each quarter hour of time spent by those personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| (20.0, 'USD')  | (4) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $20.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| (25.0, 'USD')  | When OSC determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will amount to more than $25.00, OSC shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated.                                                                                                               |
| (25.0, 'USD')  | In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until the requester agrees to pay the anticipated total fee.                                                                                                                                             |
| (250.0, 'USD') | (2) Where OSC determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester who has a history of prompt payment. |
| (10.0, 'USD')  | Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
