| 3.0 year    | The period of time during which CBP must control an agent's assignment to a regular tour of duty (i.e., the control period) begins on the date 3 years before the agent meets age and service requirements for an immediate retirement and remains in effect during all subsequent service in a Border Patrol agent position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
