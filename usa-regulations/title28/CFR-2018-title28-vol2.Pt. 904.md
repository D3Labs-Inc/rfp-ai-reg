# Summary

Pursuant to the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact (Compact), title 42, U.S.C., chapter 140, subchapter II, section 14616, Article IV (c), the Compact Council hereby establishes record screening standards for criminal history record information received by means of the III System for noncriminal justice purposes.
The following record screening standards relate to criminal history record information received for noncriminal justice purposes as a result of a national search subject to the Compact utilizing the III System.
(a) The State Criminal History Record Repository or an authorized agency in the receiving state will complete the record screening required under &#167;&#8201;904.2 for all noncriminal justice purposes.
Such record screening will be conducted pursuant to the receiving state's applicable statute, executive order, regulation, formal determination or directive of the state attorney general, or other applicable legal authority.
(c) If the state receiving the record has no law, regulation, executive order, state attorney general directive, or other legal authority providing guidance on the screening of criminal history record information received from the FBI or another state as a result of a national search, then the record screening under &#167;&#8201;904.3(a) shall be performed in the same manner in which the state screens its own records for noncriminal justice purposes.
