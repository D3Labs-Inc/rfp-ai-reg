# Summary

In developing an inmate's financial plan, the unit team shall first subtract from the trust fund account the inmate's minimum payment schedule for UNICOR or non-UNICOR work assignments, set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
(2) An inmate shall receive performance pay only for those hours during which the inmate is actively participating in a work assignment or an education/vocational program.
An inmate may receive special bonus pay based on the inmate's exceptional work in a temporary job assignment, provided this assignment has been previously identified by the Warden, and approved by the Regional Director, as critical to the institution.
(b) With prior approval of the Psychology Services Department, each inmate who is making satisfactory progress or completes a residential drug treatment program may also be granted an achievement award from performance pay funds.
(a) Inmates who perform exceptional services not ordinarily a part of the inmate's regular assignment may be granted a special award regardless of the inmate's work or program status.
The Warden shall ensure that staff receive training on their roles in, and on the operation of, the work and performance pay program.
