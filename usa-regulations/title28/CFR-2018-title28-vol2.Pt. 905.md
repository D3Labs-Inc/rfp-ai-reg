# ID

 CFR-2018-title28-vol2.Pt. 905


# Summary

&#8220;National Fingerprint File&#8221; means a database of fingerprints, or other uniquely personal identifying information, relating to an arrested or charged individual maintained by the FBI to provide positive identification of record subjects indexed in the III System.
The purpose of this part 905 is to require each National Fingerprint File (NFF) participant to meet the standards set forth in the NFF Qualification Requirements as established by the Compact Council (Council).
The Council is established pursuant to the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Act (Compact), title 42, U.S.C., &#167;&#8201;14616.
Each NFF Program participant shall meet the standards set forth in the NFF Qualification Requirements as established by the Council and endorsed by the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Advisory Policy Board; however, such standards shall not interfere or conflict with the FBI's administration of the III, including the NFF, for criminal justice purposes.
Each participant's performance will be audited and measured by criteria designed to assess compliance with those requirements.
Measurements by which to determine compliance to the NFF Qualification Requirements are outlined in the FBI and State Sampling Standards.
(For a copy of the standards, contact the FBI Compact Officer, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Module C-3, Clarksburg, WV 26306-0001.)
