| 1978-05-03 | (a) Under an approved regulatory program, surface coal mining activities may be conducted under a variance from the requirement of this subchapter for restoring affected areas to their approximate original contour, if&#8212;                                                                                                           |
|            |             (1) The regulatory authority grants the variance under a permit, in accordance with 30 CFR 785.14;                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |             (2) The activities involve the mining of an entire coal seam running through the upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill, by removing all of the overburden and creating a level plateau or gently rolling contour with no highwalls remaining;                                                                           |
|            |             (3) An industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or public facility (including recreational facilities) use is proposed and approved for the affected land;                                                                                                                                                           |
|            |             (4) The alternative land use requirements of &#167;&#8201;816.133(a) through (c) of this chapter are met;                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |             (5) All applicable requirements of this subchapter and the regulatory program, other than the requirement to restore affected areas to their approximate original contour, are met;                                                                                                                                            |
|            |             (6) An outcrop barrier of sufficient width, consisting of the toe of the lowest coal seam, and its associated overburden, are retained to prevent slides and erosion, except that the regulatory authority may permit an exemption to the retention of the coal barrier requirement if the following conditions are satisfied: |
|            |             (i) The proposed mine site was mined prior to May 3, 1978, and the toe of the lowest seam has been removed; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            |             (ii) A coal barrier adjacent to a head-of-hollow fill may be removed after the elevation of a head-of-hollow fill attains the elevation of the coal barrier if the head-of-hollow fill provides the stability otherwise ensured by the retention of a coal barrier;                                                            |
