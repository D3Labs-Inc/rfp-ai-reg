| 1977-08-03 | (4) For purposes of this section:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |             (i) &#8220;Renewal&#8221; of a permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to extend the time by which the permittee may complete mining within the boundaries of the original permit, and &#8220;revision&#8221; of the permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to allow changes in the method of mining operations within the original permit area, or the decision of the regulatory authority to allow incidental boundary changes to the original permit; |
|            |             (ii) A pit shall be deemed to be a single continuous mining pit even if portions of the pit are crossed by a road, pipeline, railroad, or powerline or similar crossing;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|            |             (iii) A single continuous surface coal mining operation is presumed to consist only of a single continuous mining pit under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977, but may include non-contiguous parcels if the operator can prove by clear and convincing evidence that, prior to August 3, 1977, the non-contiguous parcels were part of a single permitted operation.                                                                                                                  |
