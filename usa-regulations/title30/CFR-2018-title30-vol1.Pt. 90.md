| 1971-10-27 | A miner employed at a coal mine who has exercised the option under the old section 203(b) program (36 FR 20601, October 27, 1971), or under &#167;&#8201;90.3 of this part to work in an area of a mine where the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which that miner is exposed is continuously maintained at or below the applicable standard, and who has not waived these rights. |
| 1981-01-31 | (b) Any miner who is a section 203(b) miner on January 31, 1981, shall be a part 90 miner on February 1, 1981, entitled to full rights under this part to retention of pay rate, future actual wage increases, and future work assignment, shift and respirable dust protection.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1981-02-01 | (b) Any miner who is a section 203(b) miner on January 31, 1981, shall be a part 90 miner on February 1, 1981, entitled to full rights under this part to retention of pay rate, future actual wage increases, and future work assignment, shift and respirable dust protection.                                                                                                                                                        |

| 2018-10-25 | Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that part 90 miner shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.4 mg/m3 (10/25.6% = 0.4 mg/m3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1981-01-31 | (d) The operator shall compensate each miner who is a section 203(b) miner on January 31, 1981, at not less than the regular rate of pay that the miner is required to receive under section 203(b) of the Act immediately before the effective date of this part.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1971-10-27 | (g) If a part 90 miner is transferred, and the Secretary subsequently notifies the miner that notice of the miner's eligibility to exercise the part 90 option was incorrect, the operator shall retain the affected miner in the current position to which the miner is assigned and continue to pay the affected miner the applicable rate of pay provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section, until:               |
|            |               (1) The affected miner and operator agree in writing to a position with pay at not less than the regular rate of pay for that occupation; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (2) A position is available at the same coal mine in both the same occupation and on the same shift on which the miner was employed immediately before exercising the option under &#167;&#8201;90.3 or under the old section 203(b) program (36 FR 20601, October 27, 1971).                                                                                                                                             |
| 2016-02-01 | On February 1, 2016, part 90 miners shall be sampled only with an approved continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM) as required by this part and an approved CMDPSU shall not be used, unless notified by the Secretary to continue to use an approved CMDPSU to conduct quarterly sampling.                                                                                                                                             |
