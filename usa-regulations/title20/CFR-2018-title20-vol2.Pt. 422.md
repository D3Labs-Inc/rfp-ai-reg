| 15.0 day   | (i) If the petition for hearing is filed after the 15-day period provided in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, we may grant the request if the employee can establish either that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or that the employee failed to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 60.0 day   | This opinion is based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the hearing petition was received by the creditor agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 60.0 day   | This is dependent upon whether the employee requested a delay in the proceedings and the hearing official grants it, in which case the 60-day decision period will be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 60.0 day   | The recipient of an employee's request for a hearing must forward the request expeditiously to the hearing official to avoid jeopardizing the hearing official's ability to issue a decision within this 60-day period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
