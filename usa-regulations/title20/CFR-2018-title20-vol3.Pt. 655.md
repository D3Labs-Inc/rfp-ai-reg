| 2005-03-08 | Furthermore, on all H-1B LCAs filed from January 19, 2001 through September 30, 2003, and on or after March 8, 2005, an employer will be required to attest whether it is an H-1B-dependent employer or willful violator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2018-03-01 | The employer is required to designate its status by marking the appropriate box on the Form ETA-9035 or 9035E (i.e., either H-1B-dependent or non-H-1B-dependent).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2001-01-19 | Similarly, an employer that is or becomes H-1B-dependent cannot continue to use an LCA filed before January 19, 2001 to support new H-1B petitions or requests for extension of status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1998-10-21 | (ii) The agency finds that the employer has committed either a willful failure or a misrepresentation of a material fact during the five-year period preceding the filing of the LCA; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
