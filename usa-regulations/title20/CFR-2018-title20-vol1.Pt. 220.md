| 3.0 month   | (v) A period of disability can also be established on the basis of an application filed within 3 months after the month a disabled employee died.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12.0 month  | Before deciding that the claimant is not disabled, the Board will develop a complete medical history (i.e., evidence from the records of the claimant's medical sources) covering at least the preceding 12 months, unless the claimant says that his or her disability began less than 12 months before he or she filed an application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 20.0 day    | Every reasonable effort means that the Board will make an initial request and, after 20 days, one follow-up request to the claimant's medical source to obtain the medical evidence necessary to make a determination before the Board evaluates medical evidence obtained from another source on a consultative basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10.0 day    | The medical source will have 10 days from the follow-up request to reply (unless experience indicates that a longer period is advisable in a particular case).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 12.0 month  | Two or more unrelated severe impairments cannot be combined to meet the 12-month duration test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12.0 month  | If the claimant has a severe impairment(s) and then develops another unrelated severe impairment(s) but neither one is expected to last for 12 months, he or she cannot be found disabled even though the 2 impairments in combination last for 12 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12.0 month  | If the claimant has a severe impairment(s) and then develops another unrelated severe impairment(s) but neither one is expected to last for 12 months, he or she cannot be found disabled even though the 2 impairments in combination last for 12 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12.0 month  | If the claimant has 2 or more concurrent impairments which, when considered in combination, are severe, the board must also determine whether the combined effect of the impairments can be expected to continue to be severe for 12 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12.0 month  | If 1 or more of the claimant's impairments improves or is expected to improve within 12 months, so that the combined effect of the claimant's impairments is no longer severe, he or she will be found to not meet the 12-month duration test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 15.0 year   | The Board considers that the claimant's work experience is relevant and applies when it was done within the last 15 years, lasted long enough for him or her to learn to do it, and was substantial gainful activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15.0 year   | This work experience is called &#8220;past relevant work.&#8221; The Board does not usually consider that work the claimant did 15 years or more before the time the Board is deciding whether he or she is disabled (or when the disability insured status requirement was last met, if earlier) applies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15.0 year   | A gradual change occurs in most jobs so that after 15 years, it is no longer realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired in a job done then continue to apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15.0 year   | The 15-year guide is intended to insure that remote work experience is not currently applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15.0 year   | If the claimant has no work experience or worked only &#8220;off-and-on&#8221; or for brief periods of time during the 15-year period, the Board generally considers that these do not apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15.0 year   | (2) The Board will ask for the following information about all the jobs the claimant has had in the last 15 years:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|             |               (i) The dates the claimant worked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 15.0 year   | (3) If all the claimant's work in the past 15 years has been arduous and unskilled, and the claimant has very little education, the Board will ask the claimant to tell about all of his or her work from the time he or she first began working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30.0 day    | Unskilled work is work which needs little or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time (30 days).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30.0 day    | A job is considered unskilled if the claimant can usually learn to do the job in 30 days, and little job training and judgment are needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 45.0 hour   | If the claimant's business involves the services of more than one person, the Board will consider the claimant to be rendering significant services if he or she contributes more than half the total time required for the management of the business or he or she renders management services for more than 45 hours a month regardless of the total management time required by the business.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2.0 hour    | For example, an attendant gets the claimant ready for work and helps the claimant in returning from work, which takes about 2 hours a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8.0 hour    | The rest of the attendant's 8-hour day is spent cleaning the claimant's house and doing the claimant's laundry, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12.0 month  | In these situations the Board will determine the total payment that the claimant will make over a 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the downpayment and allocate that amount over the 12 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12.0 month  | This allocation process will be for a shorter period if the claimant's regular monthly payments will extend over a period of less than 12 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11.0 month  | A payment made toward the cost of a deductible item that the claimant made in any of the 11 months preceding the month he or she started working will be taken into account in determining the claimant's impairment-related work expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11.0 month  | When an item is paid for in full during the 11 months preceding the month the claiment started working, the payment will be allocated over the 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3.0 month   | For example, if an item is purchased 3 months before the month work began and is paid for with a one-time payment of $600, the deductible amount would be $450 ($600 divided by 12, multiplied by 9).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11.0 month  | Installment payments (including a downpayment) that the claimant made for a particular item during the 11 months preceding the month he or she started working will be totalled and considered to have been made in the month of the claimant's first payment for that item within this 11-month period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 11.0 month  | The sum of these payments will be allocated over the 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the claimant's first payment (but never earlier than 11 months before the month work began).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.0 month   | For example, if an item is purchased 3 months before the month work began and is paid for in 3 monthly installments of $200 each, the total payment of $600 will be considered to have been made in the month of the first payment, that is, 3 months before the month work began.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 15.0 year   | In addition, a gradual change occurs in most jobs so that after about 15 years, it is no longer realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired in these jobs will continue to apply to the current workplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20.0 day    | The Board will make every reasonable effort to help the annuitant in getting medical reports when he or she gives the Board permission to request them from his or her physician, psychologist, or other medical sources, Every reasonable effort means that the Board will make an initial request and, after 20 days, one follow-up request to the annuitant's medical source to obtain the medical evidence necessary to make a determination before the Board evaluates medical evidence obtained from another source on a consultative basis.        |
| 10.0 day    | The medical source will have 10 days from the follow-up to reply (unless experience indicates that a longer period is advisable in a particular case).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12.0 month  | Before deciding that an annuitant's disability has ended, the Board will develop a complete medical history covering at least the preceding 12 months (See &#167;&#8201;220.45(b)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1.0 year    | Improvement in such impairment(s) that is only temporary, i.e., less than 1 year, will not warrant a finding of medical improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1 month     | The month in which the annuitant's disability ends will be the first month in which he or she failed to do what was requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|             |               (h) The first month the annuitant was told by his or her physician that he or she could return to work provided there is no substantial conflict between the physician's and the annuitant's statements regarding that annuitant's awareness of his or her capacity for work and the earlier date is supported by the medical evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12.0 month  | The impairment(s) need not be expected to last 12 months or to result in death, but it must be severe enough to keep the annuitant from doing substantial gainful activity, or severe enough so that he or she is still disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12.0 month  | In doing a medical review the Board will develop a complete medical history of at least the preceding 12 months in any case in which a determination is made that the annuitant is no longer under a disability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6.0 month   | Generally, the diary period is set for not less than 6 months or for not more than 18 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 6.0 month   | If an annuitant's impairment is expected to improve, generally the Board will review the annuitant's continuing eligibility for disability benefits at intervals from 6 months to 18 months following the Board's most recent decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18.0 month  | If an annuitant's impairment is expected to improve, generally the Board will review the annuitant's continuing eligibility for disability benefits at intervals from 6 months to 18 months following the Board's most recent decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3.0 year    | If the annuitant's disability is not considered permanent but is such that any medical improvement in the annuitant's impairment(s) cannot be accurately predicted, the Board will review the annuitant's continuing eligibility for disability benefits at least once every 3 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.0 year    | If the annuitant was found eligible to receive or to continue to receive disability benefits on the basis of a decision by a hearings officer, the three-member Board or a Federal court, the agency will not conduct a continuing disability review earlier than 3 years after that decision unless the annuitant's case should be scheduled for a medical improvement expected or vocational reexamination diary review or a question of continuing disability is raised pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.                                     |
| 3.0 year    | All cases involving a nonpermanent impairment will be reviewed by the Board at least once every 3 years unless the Board determines that the requirements should be waived to ensure that only the appropriate number of cases are reviewed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3.0 year    | Therefore, an annuitant's continuing disability review may be delayed longer than 3 years following the Board's original decision or other review under certain circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1980-12-01 | The reentitlement period begins with the first month following completion of nine months of trial work but cannot begin earlier than December 1, 1980.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-12-01 | When the Board cannot decide whether the claimant is disabled on medical evidence alone, the Board must use other evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2018-12-01 | However, if the findings of fact made about all factors are the same as the rule, the Board uses that rule to decide whether that claimant is disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2018-12-01 | Sections 220.100(b)(5) and 220.180(h) of this part explain that if the claimant can no longer do the claimant's past relevant work because of a severe medically determinable impairment(s), the Board must determine whether the claimant's impairment(s), when considered along with the claimant's age, education, and work experience, prevents the claimant from doing any other work which exists in the national economy in order to decide whether the claimant is disabled or continues to be disabled. |
| 2018-12-01 | When the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms only impose exertional limitations and the claimant's specific vocational profile is listed in a rule contained in appendix 2 of this part, the Board will directly apply that rule to decide whether the claimant is disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-12-01 | The Board will consider all of the medical and vocational evidence in the claimant's file to decide whether or not the claimant has the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-12-01 | While the time the claimant spends in work is important, the Board will not decide whether or not the claimant is doing substantial gainful activity only on that basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2018-12-01 | The Board will still evaluate the work to decide whether it is substantial and gainful regardless of whether the claimant spends more time or less time at the job than workers who are not impaired and who are doing similar work as a regular means of their livelihood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2001-01-01 | The Board will consider that the earnings from the employed claimant (including earnings from sheltered work, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section) show that the claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity if:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
