| 30.0 day    | (4) In cases where the transfer is beyond reasonable commuting distance, the employer may become liable for failure to give notice if an offer to transfer is not accepted within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or layoff (whichever is later).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 60.0 day    | Depending upon when the offer of transfer was made by the employer, the normal 60-day notice period may have expired and the plant closing or mass layoff may have occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 60.0 day    | An employer is, therefore, well advised to provide 60-day advance notice as part of the transfer offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 60.0 day    | The unforeseeable business circumstances exception to 60 days' notice also may apply to these closings or layoffs at other plants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 60.0 day    | (2) Where voluntary notice has been given more than 60 days in advance, but does not contain all of the required elements set out in this section, the employer must ensure that all of the information required by this section is provided in writing to the parties listed in &#167;&#8201;639.6 at least 60 days in advance of a covered employment action.                                                                                                                |
| 60.0 day    | (2) Where voluntary notice has been given more than 60 days in advance, but does not contain all of the required elements set out in this section, the employer must ensure that all of the information required by this section is provided in writing to the parties listed in &#167;&#8201;639.6 at least 60 days in advance of a covered employment action.                                                                                                                |
| 60.0 day    | (3) Notice may be given conditional upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event, such as the renewal of a major contract, only when the event is definite and the consequences of its occurrence or nonoccurrence will necessarily, in the normal course of business, lead to a covered plant closing or mass layoff less than 60 days after the event.                                                                                                                   |
| 30.0 day    | For example, if the non-renewal of a major contract will lead to the closing of the plant that produces the articles supplied under the contract 30 days after the contract expires, the employer may give notice at least 60 days in advance of the projected closing date which states that if the contract is not renewed, the plant closing will occur on the projected date.                                                                                              |
| 60.0 day    | For example, if the non-renewal of a major contract will lead to the closing of the plant that produces the articles supplied under the contract 30 days after the contract expires, the employer may give notice at least 60 days in advance of the projected closing date which states that if the contract is not renewed, the plant closing will occur on the projected date.                                                                                              |
| 14.0 day    | (b) As used in this section, the term &#8220;date&#8221; refers to a specific date or to a 14-day period during which a separation or separations are expected to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14.0 day    | If separations are planned according to a schedule, the schedule should indicate the specific dates on which or the beginning date of each 14-day period during which any separations are expected to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 1 day       | Where a 14-day period is used, notice must be given at least 60 days in advance of the first day of the period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 60.0 day    | Any reasonable method of delivery to the parties listed under &#167;&#8201;639.6 of this part which is designed to ensure receipt of notice of least 60 days before separation is acceptable (e.g., first class mail, personal delivery with optional signed receipt).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
