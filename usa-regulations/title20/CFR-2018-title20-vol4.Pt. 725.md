| 1 month    | If a claimant dies in the first month during which all requirements for eligibility are met, benefits shall be paid for that month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1.0 year   | (a) In the case of a claimant who is employed as a miner (see &#167;&#8201;725.202) at the time of a final determination of such miner's eligibility for benefits, no benefits shall be payable unless:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |                 (1) The miner's eligibility is established under section 411(c)(3) of the Act; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            |                 (2) the miner terminates his or her coal mine employment within 1 year from the date of the final determination of the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1.0 year   | If eligibility cannot be established under section 411(c)(3), and the miner continues to be employed as a miner in any capacity for a period of less than 1 year after a final determination of the claim, benefits shall be payable beginning with the month during which the miner ends his or her coal mine employment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1.0 year   | If the miner's employment continues for more than 1 year after a final determination of eligibility, such determination shall be considered a denial of benefits on the basis of the miner's continued employment, and the miner may seek benefits only as provided in &#167;&#8201;725.310, if applicable, or by filing a new claim under this part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1 month    | (2) The benefits of a miner or surviving spouse are augmented to take account of a particular dependent beginning with the first month in which such dependent satisfies the conditions set forth in this part, and continues to be augmented through the month before the month in which such dependent ceases to satisfy the conditions set forth in this part, except in the case of a child who qualifies as a dependent because he or she is a student.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1 month    | In the latter case, such benefits continue to be augmented through the month before the first month during no part of which he or she qualifies as a student.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day   | (a) If an operator or carrier fails or refuses to commence the payment of benefits within 30 days of issuance of an initial determination of eligibility by the district director (see &#167;&#8201;725.420), or fails or refuses to commence the payment of any benefits due pursuant to an effective order by a district director, administrative law judge, Benefits Review Board, or court, the fund shall commence the payment of such benefits and shall continue such payments as appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10.0 day   | In addition, a claimant who does not receive any benefits within 10 days of the date they become due is entitled to additional compensation equal to twenty percent of those benefits (see &#167;&#8201;725.607).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5.0 year   | No operator or carrier shall be required to retain receipts for payments made for more than 5 years after the date on which such receipt was executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6.0 year   | (6) The liability imposed by this paragraph may be collected at a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date upon which the liability was finally determined, or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the operator and the United States before the expiration of such 6-year period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
