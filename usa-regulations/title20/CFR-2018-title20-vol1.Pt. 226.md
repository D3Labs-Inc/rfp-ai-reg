| 1 day      | Annuity means a payment due an entitled individual for a calendar month and payable to him or her on the first day of the following month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30.0 year  | Except in the case of an employee who retires at age 60 with 30 years of service, if the result is not a multiple of $1, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30.0 year  | In the case of an employee who retires with an age reduced annuity based upon 30 years of service (see &#167;&#8201;216.31 of this chapter) the tier I is not rounded until all reductions have been made.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30.0 year  | If the employee retires before age 62 with at least 30 years of service, the employee is deemed age 62 for age reduction purposes and a 20% reduction is applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30.0 year  | In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see &#167;&#8201;216.31 of this chapter), the age reduction only applies to the tier I component; no age reduction applies to the tier II component.                                                                                                                                         |
| 10.0 year  | An employee who worked for a railroad in 1974 and retired after 1974 is considered vested if on December 31, 1974, he or she had both 10 years of railroad service and sufficient quarters of coverage under the Social Security Act to qualify for a social security benefit.                                                                                                             |
| 10.0 year  | (3) An employee who completed 10 years or more years of railroad service (but less than 25) before 1975 but left the industry before 1975 and did not have a current connection on December 31, 1974 or when he or she retired.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 30.0 year  | In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is entitled to an annuity reduced for age, the age reduction applies only to the tier I component; no age reduction applies to the vested dual benefit.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 25.0 year  | The supplemental annuity is equal to $23 plus $4 for each full year of service, over 25 years of service, up to a maximum of $43.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30.0 year  | In the case of an employee who retires before age 62 with 30 years of service, the spouse tier I is simply 50% of the employee tier I until the first month throughout which both the employee and spouse are age 62 at which time the tier I is an amount similar to the social security benefit on the employee's combined railroad and social security earnings.                        |
| 1 month    | In the case of an employee who retires before age 62 with 30 years of service, the spouse tier I is simply 50% of the employee tier I until the first month throughout which both the employee and spouse are age 62 at which time the tier I is an amount similar to the social security benefit on the employee's combined railroad and social security earnings.                        |
| 30.0 year  | However, in cases in which the spouse is in receipt of an age reduced 60/30 annuity or in which the employee with 30 years of service began a disability annuity July 1, 1984, or later, the spouse tier I is not rounded until all reductions have been made.                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 year  | In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is awarded a disability annuity on July 1, 1984, or later, where the spouse does not have a child of the employee under age 18 in care, the spouse tier I is reduced for each month the spouse is under retirement age on the date the spouse annuity begins.                                                                      |
| 20.0 year  | The January 1977 requirements are, for a man, a one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section), and, for a woman claiming benefits as a divorced spouse, marriage for at least 20 years to the insured worker.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10 year    | This railroad retirement family maximum amount varies according to the employee's earnings in the ten-year period that ends with the year in which his or her annuity begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10.0 year  | For this purpose, the FAMC is determined by dividing the individual's total earnings up to the tier II earnings limit as shown in part 211 of this chapter for the two highest-earnings years out of the last 10 calendar years, including the year of retirement, by 24.                                                                                                                  |
| 12 month   | Military service can be used as service and compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act starting with the date the annuity begins but no earlier than twelve months before the employee files an application or statement showing that he or she has military service.                                                                                                                  |
| 60.0 month | The employee's average monthly compensation is computed by first determining the employee's highest 60 months of railroad compensation (disregarding compensation in excess of the maximum creditable tier II compensation for that year).                                                                                                                                                 |
| 60.0 month | The total of the highest 60 months is then divided by 60 to determine the average monthly compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 60.0 month | (b) For employee with government employment and no railroad service for 60-month period before annuity begins&#8212;(1) General.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1974-12-31 | An employee who worked for a railroad in 1974 and retired after 1974 is considered vested if on December 31, 1974, he or she had both 10 years of railroad service and sufficient quarters of coverage under the Social Security Act to qualify for a social security benefit.                                                                                                                                              |
| 1974-12-31 | An employee qualified on this basis is eligible for vested dual benefit amounts computed on his or her railroad and social security credits through December 31, 1974.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1974-12-31 | An employee who did not work in the railroad industry in 1974, but who had 25 or more years of railroad service before 1975 or a current connection with the railroad industry on December 31, 1974, as defined in part 216 of this chapter, or a current connection when he or she retired, is also considered vested under the same conditions as an employee who had worked in the railroad industry in 1974.            |
| 1974-12-31 | (3) An employee who completed 10 years or more years of railroad service (but less than 25) before 1975 but left the industry before 1975 and did not have a current connection on December 31, 1974 or when he or she retired.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1974-12-31 | The vested dual benefit amount is based only on credits acquired through the last year of pre-1975 railroad service instead of through December 31, 1974.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 1975-06-01 | If the employee's annuity begins June 1, 1975 or later, a cost-of-living increase is added to the total vested dual benefit amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1975-01-01 | This increase is based on the cost-of-living increases in social security benefits during the period from January 1, 1975, to the earlier of the date the employee's annuity begins or January 1, 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1982-01-01 | This increase is based on the cost-of-living increases in social security benefits during the period from January 1, 1975, to the earlier of the date the employee's annuity begins or January 1, 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1984-07-01 | However, in cases in which the spouse is in receipt of an age reduced 60/30 annuity or in which the employee with 30 years of service began a disability annuity July 1, 1984, or later, the spouse tier I is not rounded until all reductions have been made.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1984-07-01 | In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is awarded a disability annuity on July 1, 1984, or later, where the spouse does not have a child of the employee under age 18 in care, the spouse tier I is reduced for each month the spouse is under retirement age on the date the spouse annuity begins.                                                                                                       |
| 1977-12-01 | (2) If the annuitant receives or is eligible to receive a government pension for one or more months in the period December 1977 through November 1982 and he or she meets the requirements for social security benefits that were applied in January 1977 (even though he or she did not actually claim such benefits nor become entitled to such benefits until a later month).                                            |
| 1982-11-01 | (2) If the annuitant receives or is eligible to receive a government pension for one or more months in the period December 1977 through November 1982 and he or she meets the requirements for social security benefits that were applied in January 1977 (even though he or she did not actually claim such benefits nor become entitled to such benefits until a later month).                                            |

| 1977-01-01 | The January 1977 requirements are, for a man, a one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section), and, for a woman claiming benefits as a divorced spouse, marriage for at least 20 years to the insured worker.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1983-07-01 | A person is considered eligible for a government pension for any month in which he or she meets all the requirements for payment except that he or she is working or has not applied; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |               (3) If the annuitant was receiving or eligible (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) to receive a government pension for one or more months before July 1983, and he or she meets the one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section).                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1982-12-01 | If the annuitant meets the exception in this paragraph but he or she does not meet the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, December 1982 is the earliest month for which the reduction will not affect his benefits; or                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |               (4) If the annuitant has been eligible for a government pension in a given month except for a requirement which delayed eligibility for such pension until the month following the month in which all other requirements were met, the Board will consider the annuitant to be eligible in that given month for the purpose of meeting one of the exceptions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. |
