| (15.0, 'USD')  | A payment by a local lodge of a labor organization to an employee for services as a local lodge official shall be regarded as subsidiary remuneration if such payment does not exceed an average of $15 a day for the period with respect to which it is payable or accrues, unless there is information that the work from which the payment is derived does not require substantially less than full time as determined by generally prevailing standards, or is not susceptible of performance at such times and under such circumstances as not to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time employment in another occupation. |
| (15.0, 'USD')  | The term &#8220;subsidiary remuneration&#8221; means remuneration not in excess of an average of $15 per day for the period with respect to which it is payable or accrues, if                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|                |             (2) The work is susceptible of performance at such times and under such circumstances as not to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time employment in another occupation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| (15.0, 'USD')  | Compensation in excess of an average of $15 per day is remuneration for the days for which it is payable or accrues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (15.0, 'USD')  | The &#8220;period&#8221; of time used in determining whether remuneration averages more than $15 per day depends on the terms and conditions of the employment and the rate of payment for the work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (15.0, 'USD')  | If the claimant is paid a monthly salary, the &#8220;month&#8221; is the period with respect to which the pay must average not more than $15 per day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| (20.0, 'USD')  | For example, earnings of $20 on one day and $10 on another day do not average out to $15 per day so as to permit both days to be considered as days of unemployment or days of sickness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| (15.0, 'USD')  | Earnings that average more than $15 per day are not subsidiary remuneration under any circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (15.0, 'USD')  | Even if earnings do not exceed an average of $15 per day, they may still not be subsidiary remuneration if the claimant worked more than four hours per day or if the work had to be performed at such times and under such circumstances as to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time work in his or her regular railroad work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (350.0, 'USD') | (1) A claimant receives a salary of $350 per month for serving as secretary-treasurer of the local lodge of his union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| (15.0, 'USD')  | The average payment per day is not more than $15 and is, therefore, subsidiary remuneration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
