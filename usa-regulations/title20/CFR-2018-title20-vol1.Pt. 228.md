| 1983-07-01 | (3) If a survivor annuitant was receiving or eligible (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) to receive a Government pension for one or more months before July 1983, and he or she meets the one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1982-12-01 | If a survivor annuitant meets the exception in this paragraph but he or she does not meet the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, December 1982 is the earliest month for which the reduction will not affect his benefits; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |               (4) If a survivor annuitant was eligible for a Government pension in a given month except for a requirement which delayed eligibility for such pension until the month following the month in which all other requirements were met, the Board will consider the annuitant to be eligible in that given month for the purpose of meeting one of the exceptions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.                                                                               |
| 1984-11-01 | If an annuitant meets an exception solely because of this paragraph, his or her benefits will be unreduced for months after November 1984 only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1977-01-01 | For a man to meet the January 1977 requirement as provided in the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and for a man or a woman to meet the exception in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, he or she must meet a one-half support test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1983-06-01 | (1) If a survivor annuitant becomes eligible for a Government pension after June 1983, the Board will reduce (but not below zero) the tier I annuity component by two-thirds of the amount of the monthly pension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1983-07-01 | (2) If a survivor annuitant became eligible for a Government pension before July 1983 and he or she did not meet one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will reduce (but not below zero) the tier I component by the full amount of the pension for months before December 1984 and by two-thirds the amount of his or her monthly pension for months after November 1984.                                                                                                    |
| 1984-12-01 | (2) If a survivor annuitant became eligible for a Government pension before July 1983 and he or she did not meet one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will reduce (but not below zero) the tier I component by the full amount of the pension for months before December 1984 and by two-thirds the amount of his or her monthly pension for months after November 1984.                                                                                                    |
| 1984-11-01 | (2) If a survivor annuitant became eligible for a Government pension before July 1983 and he or she did not meet one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will reduce (but not below zero) the tier I component by the full amount of the pension for months before December 1984 and by two-thirds the amount of his or her monthly pension for months after November 1984.                                                                                                    |
| 1977-12-01 | This reduction is not applied to claimants who both filed and were entitled to benefits prior to December 1977.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1975-01-01 | However, this reduction does not apply (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) if the survivor or the individual upon whose earnings record the survivor annuity is based worked for a railroad employer or as an employee representative before January 1, 1975.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2018-12-01 | The cost-of-living increase is payable beginning with the benefit for the month of December of the year for which the increase is due.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2018-01-01 | The increase is paid in the January payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1984-01-01 | (b)(1) The tier II takeback amount for survivors whose annuity beginning date is January 1, 1984 or later is usually the amount of the employee's takeback amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1983-11-01 | That amount is equal to 5 percent of the employee's primary insurance amount, less all applicable reductions (net tier I), on November 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1984-01-01 | (2) The tier II takeback amount for survivors whose annuity beginning date is before January 1, 1984 is equal to 5 percent of the survivor's net tier I annuity component, before deduction on account of work, on November 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1984-01-01 | (3) The tier II takeback will be applied in accord with the above paragraphs in any case where the employee died or retired before January 1, 1984.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1983-12-31 | If the employee died or retires after December 31, 1983, or the employee never retired and dies after December 31, 1993, no takeback will be applied to the survivor's annuity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 1975-01-01 | A restored amount is added to the tier II annuity component of a widow(er)'s annuity whose annuity is reduced for receipt of an employee annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act provided either the employee or the widow(er) had ten years of creditable railroad service prior to January 1, 1975.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
