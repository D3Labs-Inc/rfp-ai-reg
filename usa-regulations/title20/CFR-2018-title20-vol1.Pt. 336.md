| (775.0, 'USD')  | For the purposes of this part, an employee's base year compensation includes any compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) for any month in the applicable base year but shall not include any amount that exceeds the value of &#8220;X&#8221; in the following formula: X = $775(A/$600).                  |
