| 2008-07-21 | While your ticket may still be considered in-use for the purpose of the suspension of continuing disability reviews, it will no longer be considered assigned to that State VR agency effective July 21, 2008.                                                                                                                        |
| 2008-07-21 | (g) Transition case is a case where milestones or outcomes had been attained before July 21, 2008 (that is, the work required to meet such a milestone or outcome had been completed by that date).                                                                                                                                   |
| 2008-07-21 | How are EN payments calculated for transition cases pending on July 21, 2008?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2008-06-30 | A Transition case is a case where a ticket had been assigned and milestones or outcomes had been attained as of June 30, 2008 (that is, the individual has completed the necessary work to trigger a milestone or outcome payment before July 21, 2008 regardless of whether the payment has actually been made).                     |
| 2008-07-21 | A Transition case is a case where a ticket had been assigned and milestones or outcomes had been attained as of June 30, 2008 (that is, the individual has completed the necessary work to trigger a milestone or outcome payment before July 21, 2008 regardless of whether the payment has actually been made).                     |
| 2008-07-21 | Since milestone and outcome payments are numbered and attained in sequence, the EN must request the final payment for which it expects payment under the prior rules before we can determine the number of the milestone or outcome payment that represents the first payment after July 21, 2008.                                    |
| 2008-07-21 | In addition, for cases on which an EN has attained an outcome payment before July 21, 2008 we must know the sum of the amount paid on the ticket before we can determine the remaining amount that can be paid in outcome payments on the ticket.                                                                                     |
| 2009-03-31 | Therefore, with respect to a ticket, we will only accept payment requests for milestones or outcomes attained under the prior rules until March 31, 2009 or until we make the first payment on the ticket under &#167;&#8201;411.525.                                                                                                 |
| 2008-07-21 | Payments to an EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) after July 21, 2008 on a transition case will be made as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
