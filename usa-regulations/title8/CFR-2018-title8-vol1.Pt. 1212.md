| 3.0 year   | Under no circumstances will a foreign medical graduate be eligible to apply for change of status to another nonimmigrant category, for an immigrant visa or for status as a lawful permanent resident prior to completing the requisite 3-year period of employment for a health care facility located in an HHS-designated shortage area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.0 year   | In all cases, the foreign medical graduate shall submit an employment contract with another health care facility located in an HHS-designated shortage area for the balance of the required 3-year period of employment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|            |             (4) Evidence that the geographic area or areas of intended employment indicated in the new H-1B petition are in HHS-designated shortage areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.0 year   | The Service shall review a new H-1B petition filed on behalf of a foreign medical graduate who has not yet fulfilled the required 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the waiver application and in the original H-1B petition to determine whether extenuating circumstances exist which warrant a change in employment, and whether the waiver granted under Pub. L. 103-416 should be affirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3.0 year   | If these criteria have been satisfied, the waiver granted to the foreign medical graduate under Pub. L. 103-416 may be affirmed, and the new H1-B petition may be approved in the exercise of discretion, thereby permitting the foreign medical graduate to serve the balance of the requisite 3-year employment period at the health care facility named in the new H-1B petition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
