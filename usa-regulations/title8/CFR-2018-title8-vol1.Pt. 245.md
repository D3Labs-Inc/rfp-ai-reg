|               |             (ii) If the alien was granted T nonimmigrant status under 8 CFR 214.11, such alien's physical presence in the CNMI before, on, or after November 28, 2009, and subsequent to the grant of T nonimmigrant status, is considered as equivalent to presence in the United States pursuant to an admission in T nonimmigrant status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 14.0 year     | (4) An applicant who is under 14 years of age is generally presumed to be a person of good moral character and is not required to submit evidence of good moral character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14.0 year     | However, if there is reason to believe that an applicant who is under 14 years of age may lack good moral character, USCIS may require evidence of good moral character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
