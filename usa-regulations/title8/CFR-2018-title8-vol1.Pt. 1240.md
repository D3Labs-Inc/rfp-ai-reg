| 5.0 day    | Before granting voluntary departure, the immigration judge shall advise the alien of the specific amount of the bond to be set and the duty to post the bond with the ICE Field Office Director within 5 business days of the immigration judge's order granting voluntary departure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30.0 day   | (ii) An alien who has been granted voluntary departure shall, within 30 days of filing of an appeal with the Board, submit sufficient proof of having posted the required voluntary departure bond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5.0 day    | The voluntary departure bond shall be posted with the ICE Field Office Director within 5 business days of the immigration judge's order granting voluntary departure, and the ICE Field Office Director may, at his or her discretion, hold the alien in custody until the bond is posted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5.0 day    | Because the purpose of the voluntary departure bond is to ensure that the alien does depart from the United States, as promised, the failure to post the bond, when required, within 5 business days may be considered in evaluating whether the alien should be detained based on risk of flight, and also may be considered as a negative discretionary factor with respect to any discretionary form of relief.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 25.0 day   | However, if the alien had waived appeal of the immigration judge's decision, the alien's failure to post the required voluntary departure bond within the period allowed means that the alternate order of removal takes effect immediately pursuant to 8 CFR 1241.1(f), except that an alien granted the privilege of voluntary departure under 8 CFR 1240.26(c) will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 120.0 day  | If voluntary departure is granted prior to the completion of removal proceedings, the immigration judge may grant a period not to exceed 120 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
