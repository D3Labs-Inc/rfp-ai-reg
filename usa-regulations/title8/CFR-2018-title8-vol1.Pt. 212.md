| 2003-09-23 | Until July 26, 2004 (or until July 26, 2005, in the case of a citizen of Canada or Mexico, who, before September 23, 2003, was employed as a TN or TC nonimmigrant health care worker and held a valid license from a U.S. jurisdiction), the temporary admission, extension of stay, or change of status of an alien described in 8 CFR part 212(d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section that is provided for under this paragraph (n) is subject to the following conditions:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            |             (i) The admission, extension of stay, or change of status may not be for a period longer than 1 year from the date of the decision, even if the relevant provision of 8 CFR 214.2 would ordinarily permit the alien's admission for a longer period;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |             (ii) The alien must obtain the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section within 1 year of the date of decision to admit the alien or to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status; and,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |             (iii) Any subsequent petition or application to extend the period of the alien's authorized stay or change the alien's nonimmigrant status must include proof that the alien has obtained the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section, if the extension or stay or change of status is sought for the primary purpose of the alien's performing labor in a health care occupation listed in paragraph (c) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
