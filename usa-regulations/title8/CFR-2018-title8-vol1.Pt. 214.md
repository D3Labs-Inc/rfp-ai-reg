| 1 year        | A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is obedience to all laws of United States jurisdictions which prohibit the commission of crimes of violence and for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1 year        | A nonimmigrant's conviction in a jurisdiction in the United States for a crime of violence for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed (regardless of whether such sentence is in fact imposed) constitutes a failure to maintain status under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 24.0 month    | If a student completes all such course requirements for another qualifying degree at a higher degree level than the first, the student may apply for a second 24-month extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 1.0 year      | (2) An H-1B petition filed on behalf of an alien who does not have a valid state or local license, where a license is otherwise required to fully perform the duties in that occupation, may be approved for a period of up to 1 year if:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|               |             (i) The license would otherwise be issued provided the alien was in possession of a valid Social Security number, was authorized for employment in the United States, or met a similar technical requirement; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|               |             (ii) The petitioner demonstrates, through evidence from the state or local licensing authority, that the only obstacle to the issuance of a license to the beneficiary is the lack of a Social Security number, a lack of employment authorization in the United States, or a failure to meet a similar technical requirement that precludes the issuance of the license to an individual who is not yet in H-1B status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1 year        | Where licensure is required in any occupation, including registered nursing, the H petition may only be approved for a period of one year or for the period that the temporary license is valid, whichever is longer, unless the alien already has a permanent license to practice the occupation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1 year        | An alien who is accorded H classification in an occupation which requires licensure may not be granted an extension of stay or accorded a new H classification after the one year unless he or she has obtained a permanent license in the state of intended employment or continues to hold a temporary license valid in the same state for the period of the requested extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
