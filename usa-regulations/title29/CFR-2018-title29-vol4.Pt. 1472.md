# Summary

(2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see &#167;&#8201;1472.225).
You must require that a copy of the statement described in &#167;&#8201;1472.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.
(2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.
Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal or State criminal drug statutes.
Cooperative agreement means an award of financial assistance that, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition of grant in &#167;&#8201;1472.650), except that substantial involvement is expected between the Federal agency and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the award.
Drug-free workplace means a site for the performance of work done in connection with a specific award at which employees of the recipient are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance.
