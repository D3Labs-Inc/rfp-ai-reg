 Labor. PART 1625â€”AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT


# ID

 CFR-2018-title29-vol4.Pt. 1625


# Summary

An &#8220;employee-pay-all&#8221; employee benefit plan is one of the &#8220;terms, conditions, or privileges of employment&#8221; with respect to which discrimination on the basis of age is forbidden under section 4(a)(1).
In order for a bona fide employee benefit plan which prescribes lower benefits for older employees on account of age to be within the section 4(f)(2) exception, it must not be &#8220;a subterfuge to evade the purposes of [the] Act.&#8221; In general, a plan or plan provision which prescribes lower benefits for older employees on account of age is not a &#8220;subterfuge&#8221; within the meaning of section 4(f)(2), provided that the lower level of benefits is justified by age-related cost considerations.
Any provision of an employee benefit plan which requires or permits the involuntary retirement of any individual specified in section 12(a) of the Act on the basis of age is a subterfuge to evade the purpose of the Act and cannot be excused under section 4(f)(2).
93-406, 29 U.S.C. 1001, 1003 (a) and (b), an employee hired at an age more than 5 years prior to normal retirement age may not be excluded from such a plan unless the exclusion is justifiable on the basis of cost considerations as set forth elsewhere in this section.

| 40.0 year  | It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual in any aspect of employment because that individual is 40 years old or older, unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40.0 year  | Favoring an older individual over a younger individual because of age is not unlawful discrimination under the ADEA, even if the younger individual is at least 40 years old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 5.0 year   | Cost comparisons and adjustments under section 4(f)(2) may be made on the basis of age brackets of up to 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5 year     | Thus a particular benefit may be reduced for employees of any age within the protected age group by an amount no greater than that which could be justified by the additional cost to provide them with the same level of the benefit as younger employees within a specified five-year age group immediately preceding theirs.                                                                        |
| 65.0 year  | For example, where an employer chooses to provide unreduced group term life insurance benefits until age 60, benefits for employees who are between 60 and 65 years of age may be reduced only to the extent necessary to achieve approximate equivalency in costs with employees who are 55 to 60 years old.                                                                                          |

| 70.0 year  | Similarly, any reductions in benefit levels for 65 to 70 year old employees cannot exceed an amount which is proportional to the additional costs for their coverage over 60 to 65 year old employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 5 year     | This practice will not violate the Act (even if reductions start before age 65), provided that the reduction for an employee of a particular age is no greater than is justified by the increased cost of coverage for that employee's specific age bracket encompassing no more than five years.                                                                                                      |

L. 93-406, 29 U.S.C. 1001, 1003 (a) and (b), an employee hired at an age more than 5 years prior to normal retirement age may not be excluded from such a plan unless the exclusion is justifiable on the basis of cost considerations as set forth elsewhere in this section.          |
| 5.0 year   | An employee hired less than 5 years prior to normal retirement age may be excluded from a defined benefit plan, regardless of whether or not the plan is covered by ERISA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 7 year     | For example, a tenure plan will not be deemed inadequate solely because it includes a probationary period somewhat longer than seven years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2 year     | (f) In order for the exemption to apply to a particular employee, the employee must have been in a &#8220;bona fide executive or high policymaking position,&#8221; as those terms are defined in this section, for the two-year period immediately before retirement.                                                                                                                                 |
| 2 year     | Thus, an employee who holds two or more different positions during the two-year period is subject to the exemption only if each such job is an executive or high policymaking position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1 year     | (h) The &#8220;annual retirement benefit,&#8221; to which covered employees must be entitled, is the sum of amounts payable during each one-year period from the date on which such benefits first become receivable by the retiree.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 60.0 day   | For purposes of determining compliance, &#8220;immediate&#8221; means that the payment of plan benefits (in a lump sum or the first of a series of periodic payments) must occur not later than 60 days after the effective date of the retirement in question.                                                                                                                                        |
| 60.0 day   | The fact that an employee will receive benefits only after expiration of the 60-day period will not preclude his retirement pursuant to the exemption, if the employee could have elected to receive benefits within that period.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1 year     | (k)(1) The annual retirement benefit must be &#8220;nonforfeitable.&#8221; Accordingly, the exemption may not be applied to any employee subject to plan provisions which could cause the cessation of payments to a retiree or result in the reduction of benefits to less than $44,000 in any one year.                                                                                              |
| 45.0 day   | (4) The 21 or 45 day period runs from the date of the employer's final offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 45.0 day   | Material changes to the final offer restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period; changes made to the final offer that are not material do not restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45.0 day   | Material changes to the final offer restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period; changes made to the final offer that are not material do not restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45.0 day   | The parties may agree that changes, whether material or immaterial, do not restart the running of the 21 or 45 day period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7.0 day    | (5) The 7 day revocation period cannot be shortened by the parties, by agreement or otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45.0 day   | (6) An employee may sign a release prior to the end of the 21 or 45 day time period, thereby commencing the mandatory 7 day revocation period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7.0 day    | (6) An employee may sign a release prior to the end of the 21 or 45 day time period, thereby commencing the mandatory 7 day revocation period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45.0 day   | This is permissible as long as the employee's decision to accept such shortening of time is knowing and voluntary and is not induced by the employer through fraud, misrepresentation, a threat to withdraw or alter the offer prior to the expiration of the 21 or 45 day time period, or by providing different terms to employees who sign the release prior to the expiration of such time period. |
| 45.0 day   | However, if an employee signs a release before the expiration of the 21 or 45 day time period, the employer may expedite the processing of the consideration provided in exchange for the waiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 10 day     | Involuntary reductions in force typically are structured along one or more of the following lines:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1978-04-06 | (2) Where lawsuits pending on the date of enactment (April 6, 1978) or filed thereafter challenge involuntary retirements which occurred either before or after that date, the amendment applies.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1986-10-01 | Section 12(a) was amended in October of 1986 by the Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99-592, 100 Stat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1987-01-01 | (2) The amendment to section 12(a) of the Act became effective on January 1, 1987, except with respect to any employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement containing a provision that would be superseded by such amendment that was in effect on June 30, 1986, and which terminates after January 1, 1987.                                         |
| 1986-06-30 | (2) The amendment to section 12(a) of the Act became effective on January 1, 1987, except with respect to any employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement containing a provision that would be superseded by such amendment that was in effect on June 30, 1986, and which terminates after January 1, 1987.                                         |

| 2018-12-01 | (v) While the particular circumstances of each termination program will determine the decisional unit, the following examples also may assist in determining when the decisional unit is other than the entire facility:                                                                                                                                       |
|            |               (A) A number of small facilities with interrelated functions and employees in a specific geographic area may comprise a single decisional unit;                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |               (B) If a company utilizes personnel for a common function at more than one facility, the decisional unit for that function (i.e., accounting) may be broader than the one facility;                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (C) A large facility with several distinct functions may comprise a number of decisional units; for example, if a single facility has distinct internal functions with no employee overlap (i.e., manufacturing, accounting, human resources), and the program is confined to a distinct function, a smaller decisional unit may be appropriate. |
