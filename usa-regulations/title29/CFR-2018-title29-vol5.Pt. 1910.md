| 2018-01-15 | (C) Where the ground-fault circuit-interrupter protection required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section is not available for receptacles other than 125-volt, single-phase, 15-, 20-, and 30-ampere, the employer shall establish and implement an assured equipment grounding conductor program covering cord sets, receptacles that are not a part of the building or structure, and equipment connected by cord and plug that are available for use or used by employees on those receptacles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2007-08-13 | (iii) On extensions of existing branch circuits that do not have an equipment grounding conductor, grounding-type receptacles may be grounded to a grounded cold water pipe near the equipment if the extension was installed before August 13, 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1981-04-16 | (iii) For installations made before April 16, 1981, electric equipment is also considered to be effectively grounded if it is secured to, and in metallic contact with, the grounded structural metal frame of a building.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
