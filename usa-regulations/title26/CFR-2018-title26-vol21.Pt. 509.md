|            |               (1) The Swiss corporation is a shareholder which controls, directly or indirectly, at the time the dividend is paid 95 percent or more of the entire voting power in the corporation paying the dividend;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |               (2) Not more than 25 percent of the gross income of the paying corporation for the three-year period immediately preceding the taxable year in which the dividend is paid consists of dividends and interest (other than dividends and interest received by such paying corporation from its own subsidiary corporations, if any);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            |               (3) The relationship between the paying corporation and the Swiss corporation has not been arranged or maintained primarily with the intention of securing the reduced rate of 5 percent; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (4) The Swiss corporation at no time during the taxable year in which such dividends are derived has a permanent establishment in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 183.0 day  | Where such individual is temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate a total of 183 days during a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1951, any compensation received by him (irrespective of when received, if received in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1951) for such labor or personal services performed in the United States during such year as an employee of, or under contract with, a nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual and fiduciary) who is a resident of Switzerland, or a Swiss corporation or other entity, whether or not such alien, corporation, or other entity is engaged in trade or business within the United States, shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from United States tax. |
| 183.0 day  | Where such individual is temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate a total of 183 days during a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1951, any compensation received by him (irrespective of when received, if received in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1951) for such labor or personal services performed in the United States during such year shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from United States tax if such compensation does not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 183.0 day  | Thus, if a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Switzerland performs personal services in the United States during the taxable year as an employee of a domestic corporation for which he receives compensation of $15,000 in the aggregate, none of such compensation shall be exempt from United States tax even though such individual is present in the United States during such year for a period or periods not exceeding a total of 183 days, since the aggregate compensation received is in excess of $10,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2 year     | Pursuant to Article XII of the convention, a professor or teacher, a nonresident alien who is a resident of Switzerland, who temporarily visits the United States for the purpose of teaching for a period not exceeding two years at any university, college, school, or other educational institution situated within the United States shall, for a period not exceeding two years from the date of his initial arrival in the United States, be exempt from United States tax with respect to his remuneration earned in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1951, for such teaching during such period not in excess of two years.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
