| (1000000.0, 'USD') | Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual or the individual's executor may allocate the individual's $1 million GST exemption at any time from the date of the transfer through the date for filing the individual's Federal estate tax return (including any extensions for filing that have been actually granted).                                                                                                              |
| (5000.0, 'USD')    | (B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the value of transferred property is not considered as being subject to inclusion in the gross estate of the spouse of the transferor, if the spouse possesses with respect to any transfer to the trust, a right to withdraw no more than the greater of $5,000 or 5 percent of the trust corpus, and such withdrawal right terminates no later than 60 days after the transfer to the trust. |
| (100000.0, 'USD')  | In each example assume that T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable trust:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| (1500000.0, 'USD') | For example, the severance of a trust is not a qualified severance if the trust is divided into two trusts, with one trust to be funded with $1,500,000 and the other trust to be funded with the balance of the original trust's assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| (250000.0, 'USD')  | (iii) Executor's liability in the case of transfers with respect to decedents dying on or after June 24, 1996 if the transfer is less than $250,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| (250000.0, 'USD')  | In the case of a direct skip occurring at death, the executor of the decedent's estate is liable for the tax imposed on that direct skip by chapter 13 and is required to file Form 706 or Form 706NA (and not Schedule R-1 of Form 706) if, at the date of the decedent's death&#8212;                                                                                                                                                              |

|            |             (i) The terms of the governing instrument of the exempt trust authorize distributions to the new trust or the retention of trust principal in a continuing trust, without the consent or approval of any beneficiary or court; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |             (ii) At the time the exempt trust became irrevocable, state law authorized distributions to the new trust or retention of principal in the continuing trust, without the consent or approval of any beneficiary or court; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |             (2) The terms of the governing instrument of the new or continuing trust do not extend the time for vesting of any beneficial interest in the trust in a manner that may postpone or suspend the vesting, absolute ownership, or power of alienation of an interest in property for a period, measured from the date the original trust became irrevocable, extending beyond any life in being at the date the original trust became irrevocable plus a period of 21 years, plus if necessary, a reasonable period of gestation. |
| 90.0 year  | For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A), the exercise of a trustee's distributive power that validly postpones or suspends the vesting, absolute ownership, or power of alienation of an interest in property for a term of years that will not exceed 90 years (measured from the date the original trust became irrevocable) will not be considered an exercise that postpones or suspends vesting, absolute ownership, or the power of alienation beyond the perpetuities period.                                                     |
| 1 year     | To terminate a GST trust election, the transferor must attach a statement (termination statement) to a Form 709 filed on or before the due date for timely filing (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) a Form 709 for the calendar year: in which is made the electing transferor's first transfer to which the GST trust election is not to apply; or that is the first calendar year for which the GST trust election is not to apply, even if no transfer is made to the trust during that year.                  |
| 60.0 day   | (B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the value of transferred property is not considered as being subject to inclusion in the gross estate of the spouse of the transferor, if the spouse possesses with respect to any transfer to the trust, a right to withdraw no more than the greater of $5,000 or 5 percent of the trust corpus, and such withdrawal right terminates no later than 60 days after the transfer to the trust.                                                                                         |
| 9 month    | In addition, no automatic allocation of GST exemption is made to a trust if, during the nine month period ending immediately after the death of the transferor&#8212;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1 day      | Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), if a transferor makes a late allocation of GST exemption to a trust, the transferor may, solely for purposes of determining the fair market value of the trust assets, elect to treat the allocation as having been made on the first day of the month during which the late allocation is made (valuation date).                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15.0 month | For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), if a pecuniary payment does not carry appropriate interest, the pecuniary payment is considered to carry appropriate interest to the extent&#8212;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |             (A) The entire payment is made or property is irrevocably set aside to satisfy the entire pecuniary payment within 15 months of the transferor's death; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            |             (B) The governing instrument or applicable local law specifically requires the executor or trustee to allocate to the pecuniary payment a pro rata share of the income earned by the fund from which the pecuniary payment is to be made between the date of death of the transferor and the date of payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6 month    | Any additional GST tax as recomputed is due and payable on the date that is six months after the event that causes the imposition of the additional estate tax under section 2032A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 90.0 day   | For a date to satisfy the definition in the preceding sentence, however, the funding must be commenced immediately upon, and funding must occur within a reasonable time (but in no event more than 90 days) after, the selected valuation date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 90 day     | (iii) Ninety-day rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 90.0 day   | For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any individual who dies no later than 90 days after a transfer occurring by reason of the death of the transferor is treated as having predeceased the transferor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6.0 month  | Generally, a transfer as to which the identity of the transferee is contingent upon the occurrence of an event is a transfer in trust; however, a transfer of property included in the transferor's gross estate, as to which the identity of the transferee is contingent upon an event that must occur within 6 months of the transferor's death, is not considered a transfer in trust solely by reason of the existence of the contingency.                                                                                              |
| 6.0 month  | A skip person distributee required to file a return on Form 706-GS(D), &#8220;Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Distributions,&#8221; or a trustee required to file a return on Form 706-GS(T), &#8220;Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,&#8221; will be allowed an automatic 6-month extension of time to file the return after the date prescribed for filing if the skip person distributee or trustee files an application under this section in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.         |
| 10.0 day   | The Commissioner may terminate an automatic extension at any time by mailing to the skip person distributee or trustee a notice of termination at least 10 days prior to the termination date designated in such notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
