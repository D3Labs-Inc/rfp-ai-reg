| 12.0 month    | For example, the fact that $252 (i.e., $21 per month for 12 months) worth of public transit passes can be excluded from gross income as a de minimis fringe in 1992 does not mean that any fringe benefit with a value equal to or less than $252 may be excluded as a de minimis fringe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1 day         | As another example, the fact that the commuting use of an employer-provided vehicle more than one day a month is an example of a benefit not excludable as a de minimis fringe (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section) does not mean that the commuting use of a vehicle up to 12 times per year is excludable from gross income as a de minimis fringe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1 day         | Examples of fringe benefits that are not excludable from gross income as de minimis fringes are: season tickets to sporting or theatrical events; the commuting use of an employer-provided automobile or other vehicle more than one day a month; membership in a private country club or athletic facility, regardless of the frequency with which the employee uses the facility; employer-provided group-term life insurance on the life of the spouse or child of an employee; and use of employer-owned or leased facilities (such as an apartment, hunting lodge, boat, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12.0 month    | For example, the fact that $180 ($15 per month for 12 months) worth of transit passes can be excluded in a year does not mean that any fringe benefit with a value equal to or less than $180 may be excluded as a de minimis fringe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1972-09-01 | (1) If a contract to which section 72 applies provides that one annuitant is to receive a fixed monthly income for life, the expected return is determined by multiplying the total of the annuity payments to be received annually by the multiple shown in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) of &#167;&#8201;1.72-9 under the age (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sex of the measuring life (usually the annuitant's).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 2018-01-01 | Similarly, even if a governmental unit is the owner of property for Federal income tax purposes generally, the property will not be treated as owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit for purposes of &#167;&#167;&#8201;1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T if the lease under which such property is leased to a non-governmental entity provides for significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
