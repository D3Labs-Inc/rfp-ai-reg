| 1 day         | The principles of paragraphs (d) through (f) of &#167;&#8201;1.909-6 apply to related income and split taxes in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011, except that the alternative method for identifying distributions of related income described in &#167;&#8201;1.909-6(d)(4) applies only to identify the amount of pre-2011 split taxes of a section 902 corporation that are suspended as of the first day of the section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 2 year        | If a redetermination of foreign income taxes claimed as a direct credit under section 901 occurs in a post-2010 taxable year and the foreign tax redetermination relates to a pre-2011 taxable year, to the extent such foreign tax redetermination increased the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to the pre-2011 taxable year (for example, due to an additional assessment of foreign tax or a payment of a previously accrued tax not paid within two years), section 909 will not apply to such taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1 year        | Thus, for example, if a lessee makes a prepayment of the first and last years' rent, and it is reasonably expected that the leased property will be export property for the first half of the lease period but not the second half of such period, the amount of the prepayment which represents the first year's rent will be considered foreign trading gross receipts if it would otherwise qualify, whereas the amount of the prepayment which represents the last year's rent will not be considered foreign trading gross receipts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 10.0 year     | In the case of a sale, reasonable expectations at the time of the sale are based on the gross receipts from all related services which may reasonably be performed at any time before the end of the 10-year period following the date of the sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10.0 year     | If under the terms of a contract for related services, the contract is renewable within 10 years after a sale of export property, or during the term of a lease of export property, related services to be performed under the renewed contract are subsidiary to the sale or lease if it is reasonably expected at the time of the renewal that the gross receipts from all related services which have been and which are to be furnished by the FSC (as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) will not exceed 50 percent of the sum of the gross receipts from the sale or lease and the gross receipts from related services furnished by the FSC (as so described).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 30 day        | In the case of a newly created or organized corporation, thirty days may elapse between the effective date of the corporation's election to be treated as a FSC and the date a bank account is opened without causing the FSC to fail the requirement that it maintain its principal bank account outside the United States at all times during the taxable year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 90.0 day      | For example, if a corporation is created or organized prior to January 1, 1985, and makes an election to be treated as a FSC within the first 90 days of 1985, the election is effective as of January 1, 1985.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30.0 day      | Thus, the FSC must open a bank account within 30 days of January 1, or as of January 31, 1985, to satisfy this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30 day        | Also, a FSC shall be treated as satisfying this requirement if the account that is regarded as its principal bank account is terminated during the taxable year, provided that (i) such termination is the result of circumstances beyond the FSC's control, and (ii) the FSC establishes a new principal bank account within thirty days after such termination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 12.0 month    | Disbursement out of the principal bank account of the FSC may be made by transferring funds from the principal bank account to a U.S. account of the FSC provided that (i) the payment of the dividends, salaries or fees to the recipients is made within 12 months of the transfer, (ii) the purpose of the expenditures is designated and, (iii) the payment of the dividends, salaries or fees is actually made out of the same U.S. account that received the disbursement from the principal bank account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 90.0 day      | If, after the FSC has filed its tax return, a determination is made by the Commissioner that all or a part of the legal or accounting fees, salaries of officers, and salaries or fees of directors of the FSC were paid by a related person without receiving reimbursement, the FSC may, nonetheless, satisfy the requirements of section 924(c)(3) if the fees and salaries were paid by the related person in good faith, and the FSC reimburses the related person for the fees and salaries paid within 90 days after the determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12.0 month    | For purposes of this paragraph (c), &#8220;solicitation&#8221; refers to any communication (by any method, including, but not limited to, telephone, telegraph, mail, or in person) by the FSC, at any time during the 12 month period (measured from the date the communication is mailed or transmitted) immediately preceding the execution of a contract relating to the transaction to a specific, targeted customer or potential customer, that specifically addresses the customer's attention to the product or service which is the subject of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1 year        | For example, if with respect to transactions during the first calendar year of a 5-year contract, a calendar year FSC incurs direct costs attributable to the transactions of $100X for advertising, all of which are foreign direct costs, and $10X for processing of customers orders and for arranging for delivery, $9X (or 90 percent of the total direct costs) of which are foreign direct costs, the FSC has satisfied the 85-percent foreign direct cost test with respect to those transactions for the taxable year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|               |               (i) A United States shareholder, in making its return of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for any taxable year, elects to secure an exclusion under section 963 for such year,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|               |               (ii) It is subsequently determined (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) that an exclusion under section 963 of subpart F income with respect to stock to which such election relates does not apply for such taxable year because of the failure of such shareholder to receive a minimum distribution for such year with respect to such stock, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|               |               (iii) Such failure is due to reasonable cause, a deficiency distribution which is received by such shareholder with respect to such stock from a foreign corporation which was the single first-tier corporation, or a corporation in the chain or group, as the case may be, with respect to which the election was made, shall count toward a minimum distribution under section 963 for such year of election if such deficiency distribution is received (except as provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) on, or within 90 days after, the date of such determination and prior to the filing of a claim under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 120.0 day     | Such claim must be filed within 120 days after the date of such determination, and the deficiency distribution must be a dividend of such a nature (except as otherwise provided in this section) as would have permitted it to count toward a minimum distribution for the taxable year of the election if it had been received by the United States shareholder during such year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 90.0 day      | If the account receivable is paid within 90 days after the date it is established (or deemed established), then as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC in which the transaction occurred which gave rise to the indebtedness, the account receivable shall be treated as an asset and, under &#167;&#8201;1.993-2(d)(3) as a trade receivable, and thus as a qualified export asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 90.0 day      | The account receivable may be paid without tax consequences, provided that such account receivable is paid within 90 days after the date it is established (or deemed established).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 90.0 day      | Such account receivable paid within such 90 days will be considered to relate to the taxable year in which the transaction occurred which gave rise thereto rather than the taxable year during which it is established or paid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 90.0 day      | (iii) If an account receivable of a DISC described in subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(5) is not paid within 90 days of the date it is established (or deemed established), then, as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC in which the transaction occurred which gives rise to the indebtedness, the account receivable shall be treated as an asset except that, if the account receivable is established (or deemed established) in a taxable year of the DISC ending on or before August 15, 1975, at the taxpayer's option, the account receivable shall be treated as an asset as of the end of such taxable year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12.0 month    | (ii) In cases in which the DISC makes a return for a short taxable year, that is, for a taxable year consisting of a period of less than 12 months, pursuant to section 443 and the regulations thereunder, or &#167;&#8201;1.991-1(b)(3), the following rules shall apply&#8212;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|               |               (a) In the case of a change in the annual accounting period of the DISC resulting in a short taxable year, the group taxable year refers collectively to the short taxable year and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the short taxable year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12.0 month    | (b) In the case of a DISC which is in existence during only part of what would otherwise be its taxable year, the group taxable year refers collectively to the short period during which the DISC was in existence and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the 12-month period ending on the last day of the short period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1984-12-31 | However, such deficiency distribution shall be treated as made out of accumulated DISC income which is not previously taxed income because it will be treated as distributed prior to December 31, 1984, to the DISC's shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 1971-12-31 | (i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is the depreciation (determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) or depletion (determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) attributable to taxable years of the member beginning after December 31, 1971, with respect to all of the group's foreign assets described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph including such assets acquired prior to the date provided in such subparagraph (2), and without regard to whether the 3-year election in paragraph (a)(5) of this section is made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
