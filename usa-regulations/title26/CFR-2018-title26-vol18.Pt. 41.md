|            |               (i) For purposes of determining the person liable for the tax determined under &#167;&#8201;41.4481-1(c)(4)(ii), each reference to a taxable period in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is treated as a reference to the period that begins on the first day of the taxable period in which the vehicle is sold and ends on the date of sale.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30.0 day   | However, if passenger fare revenue from scheduled service described in paragraph (e) of this section was derived on less than 30 days during such calendar quarter from operation of such system, the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be the last preceding test period for such system.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1 day      | (2) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, in the case of any person who commences operation of a transit system at any time on or after July 1 of any taxable period the test period for such system for that part of such taxable period beginning with the first day on which such operation was commenced shall be the calendar quarter in which falls such first day.                                                                                                                      |
| 1 day      | (2) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, in the case of any person who commences operation of a transit system at any time on or after July 1 of any taxable period the test period for such system for that part of such taxable period beginning with the first day on which such operation was commenced shall be the calendar quarter in which falls such first day.                                                                                                                      |
| 30.0 day   | However, if passenger fare revenue from scheduled service described in paragraph (e) of this section was derived on less than 30 days during such calendar quarter from operation of such system, the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be the following calendar quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1 month    | (1) During such test period such person derived passenger fare revenue from the operation of such system, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |               (2) At least 60 percent of the total of such passenger fare revenue derived by such person during such test period was attributable to (i) amounts paid for transportation which do not exceed 60 cents, (ii) amounts paid for commutation or season tickets for single trips of less than 30 miles, or (iii) amounts paid for commutation tickets for one month or less.                                                                                                                                      |
| 1 day      | Thus, if a taxable use is made of a highway motor vehicle at any time in a taxable period, the tax is imposed on the use of such vehicle for such taxable period, computed from the first day of the month in which such taxable use occurred, even though at some time in the same taxable period, before or after such taxable use occurred, the use of the vehicle may have been, or may be, exempt.                                                                                                                      |
| 1 month    | (4) The first month of each taxable period in which occurred a taxable use of each such vehicle while the vehicle was registered in the name of such person; information showing whether such vehicle was operated, while registered in the name of such person, in any prior month in such taxable period; and if such vehicle was so operated, evidence establishing that such operation was not a taxable use.                                                                                                            |
| 3.0 year   | (2) Records required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be maintained for a period of at least 3 years after the date the tax becomes due or the date the tax is paid, whichever is the later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3.0 year   | Records required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be maintained for a period of at least 3 years after the end of the taxable period for which such exemption applies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3.0 year   | Records required by paragraph (d) of this section (including any record required by paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section which relates to a claim) shall be maintained for a period of at least 3 years after the date the claim is filed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 60.0 day   | Further, a State may register a highway motor vehicle without proof of payment if the person registering the vehicle presents the original or a photocopy of a bill of sale (or other document evidencing transfer) indicating that the vehicle was purchased by the owner either as a new or used vehicle during the preceding 60 days before the date that the State receives the application for registration of such vehicle.                                                                                            |
| 4.0 month  | Registration of a vehicle subject to tax under a suspension system must be on the condition that, (i) the State receive proof of payment with respect to such vehicle no later than 4 months (or any lesser time to be determined by the State) after the beginning of the vehicle's registration period, and (ii) the State's system provides for the automatic suspension (e.g. through the use of computer-generated notices) of such vehicle's registration if no proof of payment is received within the required time. |
