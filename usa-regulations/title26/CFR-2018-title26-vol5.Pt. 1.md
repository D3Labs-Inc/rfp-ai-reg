| 1913-03-01 | Where, therefore, the law (applicable to the year in which the distribution was made, as, for example, a distribution in 1934 from earnings and profits accumulated before March 1, 1913) requires that the amount of such distribution shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution was made, there is no increase in the earnings and profits by reason of the receipt of such distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1951-01-01 | Thus, the acquiring corporation must forthwith expend the proceeds in the acquisition of similar property or stock, or in the establishment of a replacement fund, in order to avoid recognition of the gain, if the disposition occurred before January 1, 1951.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1970-12-31 | Thus, in such a case, the amount of unused credit from such unused credit years which may be taken into account in a taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning after December 31, 1970, shall be determined solely with reference to the limitation based on amount of tax for such taxable year (without reduction for the credit earned for such year).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1997-01-01 | If such a reasonable method was not used for a post-change year, subject to the exception in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the members of the controlled group described in the preceding sentence must reduce their limitations under section 382 for post-change years for which the income tax return is filed after January 1, 1997, to recapture, as quickly as possible, any limitation that members took into account in excess of the amount that would be allowable under this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
