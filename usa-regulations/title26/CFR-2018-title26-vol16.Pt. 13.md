| 2018-01-01 | For purposes of this section, the yield produced by acquired obligations is not &#8220;materially higher&#8221; than the yield produced by an issue of governmental obligations if it is reasonably expected, at the time of issue of such governmental obligations, that the adjusted yield (computed in accordance with subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph) to be produced by the acquired obligations will not exceed the adjusted yield (computed in accordance with subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph) to be produced by the issue of governmental obligations by more than one-eighth of 1 percentage point. |
| 1972-07-01 | In the case of an issue of governmental obligations issued on or before July 1, 1972, the percentage specified in the preceding sentence shall be one-half of 1 percentage point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
