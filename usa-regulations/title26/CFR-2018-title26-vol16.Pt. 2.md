| 5 year     | In the event no deposit is made into the fund for more than five years, any amounts remaining in the fund shall be removed from the fund at the discretion of the Administration and, if so removed, the fund shall be terminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 60.0 day   | In the event the Administration determines that the market value at any date of any securities in the fund has decreased to a figure which is less than 90 percent of the market value at the time of deposit into the fund, then within 60 days after the taxpayer receives notice of such determination the taxpayer shall (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph) deposit into the fund cash or securities in an amount equal to the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30.0 day   | The Administration shall not countersign such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal or transmit them to the taxpayer until the expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice by the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner or such official of the Internal Revenue Service as he may designate for the purpose consents in writing to earlier countersignature by the Administration and transmittal to the taxpayer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 5 year     | Ordinarily, under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a vessel constructed more than five years before the date on which deposits in a construction reserve fund are to be expended or obligated for acquisition of such vessel will not be considered suitable for use in carrying out the purpose of the Act, except that the five-year age limitation provided above in this sentence shall not apply to a vessel to be reconstructed before being placed in operation by the taxpayer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
