| 3.0 year   | The issuer may also rely on his own or his agent's examination of copies of income tax returns which were filed with the Internal Revenue Service and which are provided by the mortgagor or obtained by the issuer or loan originator in accordance with the procedures set forth in &#167;&#8201;301.6103(c)-1 which indicate that, during the preceding 3 years, the mortgagor did not claim deductions for taxes or interest on indebtness with respect to real property constituting his principal residence, in addition to an affidavit of the mortgagor that the requirements of &#167;&#8201;6a.103A-2(e) are met. |
| 3.0 year   | The mortgagor may also provide the issuer or his agent with an affidavit that the mortgagor was not required to file such return in accordance with section 6012 during one or all of the preceding 3 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 60.0 day   | The requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph may normally be met if the mortgagor executes an affidavit of his intent to use the residence as his principal residence within a reasonable time (e.g., 60 days) after the financing is provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 3.0 year   | A mortgagor meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the mortgagor had no present ownership interest in a principal residence at any time during the 3-year period prior to the date on which the mortgage is executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.0 year   | In the event that there is more than one mortgagor with respect to a particular residence, each of such mortgagors must meet the 3-year requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3.0 year   | A person who is liable under a note secured by the mortgage but who does not have a present ownership interest in a residence subject to the mortgage need not meet the 3-year requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.0 year   | For example, where a parent of a home purchaser cosigns the note for a child but the parent takes no interest in the residence, it is not necessary that the parent meet the 3-year requirement since the parent is not a mortgagor of the residence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
