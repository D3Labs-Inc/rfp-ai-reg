| (10000.0, 'USD')   | For example, if an electing public charity transfers $10,000 of goods and services to a noncharity that makes lobbying expenditures in return for payment by the noncharity of $2,000, the amount of the transfer governed by this paragraph (c)(3) is $8,000.                                                                                                                                 |

| (1000000.0, 'USD') | In general, the rule operates to prevent numerous organizations from being created for the purpose of avoiding the sliding-scale percentage limitation on an electing public charity's lobbying expenditures (as well as avoiding the $1,000,000 cap on a single electing public charity's lobbying expenditures).                                                                             |

| 4911-02-01 | Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems are neither direct lobbying communications under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(1) nor grass roots lobbying communications under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(2) even if the problems are of the type with which government would be expected to deal ultimately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4911-02-01 | Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems are neither direct lobbying communications under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(1) nor grass roots lobbying communications under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(2) even if the problems are of the type with which government would be expected to deal ultimately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4911-02-01 | Thus, under &#167;&#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b) (1) and (2), lobbying communications do not include public discussion, or communications with members of legislative bodies or governmental employees, the general subject of which is also the subject of legislation before a legislative body, so long as such discussion does not address itself to the merits of a specific legislative proposal and so long as such discussion does not directly encourage recipients to take action with respect to legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4911-02-01 | For example, this paragraph (c)(2) excludes from grass roots lobbying under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(2) an organization's discussions of problems such as environmental pollution or population growth that are being considered by Congress and various State legislatures, but only where the discussions are not directly addressed to specific legislation being considered, and only where the discussions do not directly encourage recipients of the communication to contact a legislator, an employee of a legislative body, or a government official or employee who may participate in the formulation of legislation.                                                                                                                                         |
| 4911-02-01 | A communication is not a direct lobbying communication under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(1) if the communication is the providing of technical advice or assistance to a governmental body, a governmental committee, or a subdivision of either in response to a written request by the body, committee, or subdivision, as set forth in &#167;&#8201;53.4945-2(d)(2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4945-02-01 | A communication is not a direct lobbying communication under &#167;&#8201;56.4911-2(b)(1) if the communication is the providing of technical advice or assistance to a governmental body, a governmental committee, or a subdivision of either in response to a written request by the body, committee, or subdivision, as set forth in &#167;&#8201;53.4945-2(d)(2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
