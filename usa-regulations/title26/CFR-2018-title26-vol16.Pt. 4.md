| 5 day      | (C) The hedging transaction and the property or expense (or category of property or expense) to which it relates must be clearly identified on the records of the controlled foreign corporation before the close of the fifth day after the day during which the hedging transaction is entered into and at a time during which there is a reasonable risk of currency loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5 day      | For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C), the foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedge becomes so related (i.e., either the day on which the hedge is first entered into or on the day on which it first relates to a qualified business transaction due to a change in its purpose).                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5 day      | The foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that does not relate to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the purpose for the hedging transaction changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30.0 day   | For example, if a controlled foreign corporation acquires property on 30-day payment terms from one person and sells that property to another person on 90 day payment terms and at prearranged prices and terms such that the foreign corporation bears no substantial economic risk with respect to the purchase and sale other than the risk of non-payment, the foreign corporation has not in substance derived income from the sale of property.                                                                                                                                           |

| 120.0 day  | If payment for services performed by a controlled foreign corporation is not made until more than 120 days after the date on which such services are performed, then the income derived by the foreign corporation constitutes income equivalent to interest to the extent that interest income would be imputed under the principles of section 483 or the original issue discount provisions (section 1271 et seq.), if&#8212;                                                                                                                                                                 |
