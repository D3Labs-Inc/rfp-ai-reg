| (5000.0, 'USD')  | If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of an employee from an annuity described in section 403(b) on account of the employee's death, is it reasonable to believe that the $5,000 death benefit exclusion of section 101(b) is not includible in gross income?                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| (5000.0, 'USD')  | Although the amount of the death benefit exclusion allowable may be limited by section 101(b)(2)(B)(iii), the payor, for withholding purposes, may use the maximum death benefit exclusion ($5,000) in computing the amount of the distribution that is subject to withholding.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (1000.0, 'USD')  | Thus, for example, if an individual receives a distribution from a stock bonus plan that includes $1,000 worth of employer stock and $5 in cash for payment of fractional shares of stock, all of the cash, but none of the stock, may be retained by the payor to satisfy the withholding obligation.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (5.0, 'USD')     | Thus, for example, if an individual receives a distribution from a stock bonus plan that includes $1,000 worth of employer stock and $5 in cash for payment of fractional shares of stock, all of the cash, but none of the stock, may be retained by the payor to satisfy the withholding obligation.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (5400.0, 'USD')  | Must these payments be aggregated for purposes of providing a single notice and election to a payee or for purposes of determining whether the floor on withholding tax (i.e., $5,400 for a married individual claiming three allowances) has been reached?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| (5400.0, 'USD')  | Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be provided to those payees whose annual payments are less than $5,400?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (5400.0, 'USD')  | Therefore, a payor may provide notice to a payee with annual payments less than $5,400 by indicating to the payee when making the first payment that no Federal income tax will be withheld unless the payee chooses to have withholding apply by filing a withholding certificate, if the payor also provides information concerning where a withholding certificate may be obtained.                                                                                                |
| (5400.0, 'USD')  | If the payor provides notice to all payees when making the first payment, the payor may, in addition, provide earlier notice as provided in section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I) to selected groups of payees, such as those payees whose annual payments are over $5,400.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| (600.0, 'USD')   | Therefore, the old law rule that distributions of less than $600 per year do not require reporting no longer applies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| (12000.0, 'USD') | Thus, for example, if a loan of $12,000 that must be repaid within 5 years is made to a common law employee with a vested account balance of $5,000, $2,000 is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), and the payor or plan administrator must withhold tax from the $2,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (5000.0, 'USD')  | Thus, for example, if a loan of $12,000 that must be repaid within 5 years is made to a common law employee with a vested account balance of $5,000, $2,000 is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), and the payor or plan administrator must withhold tax from the $2,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| (200.0, 'USD')   | Must a payor or plan administrator withhold tax on a nonperiodic distribution (including a qualified total distribution) if the amount of the distribution is less than $200?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| (200.0, 'USD')   | However, all amounts received within one taxable year of the payee from the payor or plan administrator under the same plan or arrangement must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (200.0, 'USD')   | If the payor or plan administrator does not know at the time a first payment of $200 or less is made whether there will be additional payments during the year for which aggregation is required, the payor or plan administrator need not withhold from the first payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| (200.0, 'USD')   | If distributions are made within one taxable year under more than one plan of an employer, the plan administrator or payor may, but need not, aggregate the distributions for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1 year     | The term &#8220;annuity&#8221; means a series of payments payable over a period greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as amounts received as an annuity, whether or not the payments are variable in amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3 year     | Must the payor determine whether the employee's investment in the contract is recoverable within three years?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4 year     | Under section 72(d), if the annuity payments during the first three years equal or exceed the amount contributed by the employee to the plan, no amounts are includible in income until the employee's contributions are recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3.0 year   | If the payor in question a-24 determines that the employee's investment in the contract is not recoverable within 3 years, must the payor compute the exclusion ratio under section 72(b) to calculate the amount of each payment that is not includible in gross income?                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day   | If a withholding certificate is furnished by a payee on or before the date on which payments commence, it takes effect with respect to payments made more than 30 days after the certificate is furnished, unless the payor elects to make it effective at an earlier date.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30.0 day   | If a withholding certificate is furnished by a payee after the date on which payments commence, it takes effect with respect to payments made on or after the status determination date (January 1, May 1, July 1, or October 1) that is at least 30 days after the date the certificate is filed, unless the payor elects to make it effective at an earlier date.                                                                                                                   |
| 5.0 year   | Thus, a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) that does not meet the requirements (such as the minimum 5-year period of participation in section 402(e)(4)(H)) for a lump sum distribution within the meaning of section 402(e)(4) may still be a qualified total distribution for purposes of withholding.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5 year     | A. No. A class year plan is a plan under which amounts contributed by an employer for a year become vested a number of years (e.g., five years) after the year in which the amounts are contributed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6 month    | In the case of periodic payments, notice of the election must be provided not earlier than six months before the first payment and not later than when making the first payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15 day     | If a payee utilizes electronic funds transfer and notice is mailed directly to the payee at the same time the check is issued, is the notice requirement satisfied even though the payee receives the notice fifteen days after the check is deposited?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 15.0 day   | Although it is desirable that the notice reach the payee immediately prior to or concurrent with receipt of the check, the notice requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the payee receives the notice within 15 days before or after receipt of the first payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6 month    | Since notice provided at the time of the distribution could result in delay of receipt of the benefit check if the payee elects out of withholding, notice for nonperiodic distributions should be given not earlier than six months prior to the distribution and not later than the time that will give the payee reasonable time to elect not to have withholding apply and to reply to the payor with the election information.                                                   |

| 3 year     | If the payor of a periodic payment under a qualified plan knows that an employee's investment in an annuity contract will be recovered within three years, must he provide notice of the right to elect out of withholding at the time the first payment is made?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15.0 day   | a. Yes, provided that this notice is received by the payee within 15 days of the payee's receipt of the first periodic payment after December 31, 1982, and such notice provides the means to make an election and instructions for electing not to have withholding apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30.0 day   | Payors are encouraged to give payees notice of their election opportunities at least 30 days before the first periodic payment after December 31, 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 90.0 day   | If the most recent valuation date occurred within the 90 days immediately preceding the date of distribution, the next most recent valuation date may be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5.0 year   | Thus, for example, if a loan of $12,000 that must be repaid within 5 years is made to a common law employee with a vested account balance of $5,000, $2,000 is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), and the payor or plan administrator must withhold tax from the $2,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7.0 day    | The Investment Company Act of 1940 (section 22(e)) applies to these variable annuity contracts and requires that the insurance company make a pay-out within 7 days after a payee requests a withdrawal from his contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7 day      | In this situation, the insurance company has only seven days in which to notify a payee of his right to elect out of withholding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 7 day      | Therefore, the notice and election can be provided in the following manner: (1) The insurance company may mail a notice to a payee on the day the request for withdrawal is received and (2) the notice may specify that unless the payee calls the company at a toll-free telephone number supplied on the notice within seven days of the date the request was received, the company will withhold from the distribution.                                                           |

| 1 year     | Unless the amount paid in connection with the partial surrender is one of a series of payments payable over a period of greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as an amount received as an annuity, the amount paid is not a periodic payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 10 year    | However, if a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is surrendered within ten years of the date of its issuance, or is exchanged within ten years of the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $10,000. |

| 3.0 month  | How may a payor or plan administrator request this additional delay of up to 3 months for undue hardship?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.0 month  | The payor or plan administrator may request an additional delay of up to 3 months by filing in duplicate a written statement of undue hardship signed under penalties of perjury with the director of the service center where the payor or plan administrator files Form 941 or Form 941E.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3 month    | If a plan administrator and a payor both file requests for delay and statements of undue hardship with respect to the same plan, will there be two separate three-month extensions?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

No. For withholding purposes, amounts will be considered periodic payments even though a portion of each payment is treated as an amount not received as an annuity under &#167;&#8201;1.72-2(b)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1982-08-13 | Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity that was acquired on or before August 13, 1982, or are otherwise described in section 72(e)(5), which are not treated as amounts received as an annuity under section 72, will not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1982-08-13 | Thus, for distributions that are not received as an annuity under a commercial annuity contract acquired on or before August 13, 1982, it is reasonable to believe that amounts distributed are not includible in the payee's gross income to the extent they represent unrecovered investment in the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 1982-08-13 | For commercial annuity contracts entered into after August 13, 1982, which are not described in section 72(e)(5), is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed, which are not amounts received as an annuity under section 72, are not includible in gross income?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1982-08-13 | Thus, it is not reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity contract entered into after August 13, 1982, are excludible from gross income until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the investment in the contract have been distributed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1982-08-13 | However, if a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is surrendered within ten years of the date of its issuance, or is exchanged within ten years of the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $10,000.                                                                              |
| 1982-08-13 | If a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is surrendered or exchanged ten years or more after the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $5,000.                                                                                                                                     |

| 1983-07-01 | If a payor or plan administrator qualifies for the delay described in question g-5, is there a procedure for requesting an additional delay up to July 1, 1983?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1983-04-01 | It is anticipated these requests will be carefully scrutinized and generally will be granted only in circumstances where the payor or plan administrator can reasonably expect that more than one of the conditions described in question g-6 will exist on or after April 1, 1983, and up to July 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1983-03-01 | A. Payors or plan administrators must file the statement of undue hardship on or before March 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1983-01-01 | However, no request for delay may be filed with the Internal Revenue Service before January 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1983-07-01 | A. No. A request for delay will delay the effective date only up to three months and in no case will it extend it past July 1, 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1983-03-01 | This rule will not apply in the case of an event such as strike, fire, flood, earthquake, or explosion that occurs after March 1, 1983, if compliance with the withholding provisions would have been possible absent the occurrence of the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1983-04-01 | Will a payor or plan administrator receive a response from the Internal Revenue Service as to whether a delay after April 1, 1983, has been granted?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1983-04-01 | Since these requests for delay will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the payor or plan administrator will receive a response by April 1, 1983, as to whether or not a requested delay has been granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1983-04-01 | If the request for delay is denied by the director of the service center, the payor or plan administrator is required to begin withholding by the later of April 1, 1983, or 10 days from the date on the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 1983-07-01 | If the director of the service center grants a delay up to July 1, 1983, must the payor or plan administrator retain a copy of the response from the Internal Revenue Service?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
