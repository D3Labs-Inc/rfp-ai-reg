| 3 month       | However, if the employee's spouse is initially provided with the three-month coverage through March 2002, but the spouse divorces the employee before the end of the three months and loses coverage as a result of the divorce, the divorce will constitute a qualifying event during 2002 and so entitle the spouse to elect COBRA continuation coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 45.0 day      | For example, if the plan provides coverage during the 30- and 45-day grace periods described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q&amp;A-5 but cancels coverage retroactively if payment is not made by the end of the applicable grace period, then the plan must inform a provider with respect to a qualified beneficiary for whom payment has not been received that the qualified beneficiary is covered but that the coverage is subject to retroactive termination if timely payment is not made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1 day         | Similarly, if the plan cancels coverage if it has not received payment by the first day of a period of coverage but retroactively reinstates coverage if payment is made by the end of the grace period for that period of coverage, then the plan must inform the provider that the qualified beneficiary currently does not have coverage but will have coverage retroactively to the first date of the period if timely payment is made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1 day         | With both the pay-as-you-go method and the look-back method, an employer may establish, on a reasonable and consistent basis, periods for which contributions will be made (for example, a quarterly period covering three consecutive months in a calendar year) and the dates on which such contributions will be made for that designated period (for example, the first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter in the case of an employer who has established a quarterly period for making contributions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 2054-01-01 | (g) For purposes of &#167;&#167;&#8201;54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, placement for adoption or being placed for adoption means the assumption and retention by the covered employee of a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in anticipation of the adoption of the child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2054-01-01 | A-2: (a)(1) For purposes of &#167;&#167;&#8201;54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 (except for purposes of Q&amp;A-5 in &#167;&#8201;54.4980B-2, relating to the exception from COBRA for plans maintained by an employer with fewer than 20 employees), an employee is any individual who is eligible to be covered under a group health plan by virtue of the performance of services for the employer maintaining the plan or by virtue of membership in the employee organization maintaining the plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 2054-01-01 | (2) Similarly, whenever reference is made in &#167;&#167;&#8201;54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 (except in Q&amp;A-5 of &#167;&#8201;54.4980B-2) to an employment relationship (such as by referring to the termination of employment of an employee or to an employee's being employed by an employer), the reference includes the relationship of those individuals who are employees within the meaning of this paragraph (a).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2054-01-01 | (b) For purposes of &#167;&#167;&#8201;54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, a covered employee is any individual who is (or was) provided coverage under a group health plan (other than a plan that is excepted from COBRA on the date of the qualifying event; see Q&amp;A-4 of &#167;&#8201;54.4980B-2) by virtue of being or having been an employee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2054-01-01 | However, if the employee (or former employee) is denied or not offered coverage under circumstances in which the denial or failure to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12101 through 12213, the special enrollment rules of section 9801, or the requirements of section 9802 prohibiting discrimination in eligibility to enroll in a group health plan based on health status), then, for purposes of &#167;&#167;&#8201;54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, the employee (or former employee) will be considered to have had the coverage that was wrongfully denied or not offered.                                                                                                                 |
| 2054-01-01 | A-3: For purposes of &#167;&#167;&#8201;54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries means the group of covered employees, spouses of covered employees, or dependent children of covered employees receiving coverage under a group health plan maintained by the employer or employee organization who are receiving that coverage for a reason other than the rights provided under the COBRA continuation coverage requirements and who, based on all of the facts and circumstances, are most similarly situated to the situation of the qualified beneficiary immediately before the qualifying event.                                                                                                                                  |
| 2001-12-31 | For example, if a group health plan is excepted from COBRA as a small-employer plan during the year 2001 (see Q&amp;A-5 of &#167;&#8201;54.4980B-2) and an employee terminates employment on December 31, 2001, the termination is not a qualifying event and the plan is not required to permit the employee to elect COBRA continuation coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1986-08-01 | An individual's benefits in such plans include amounts determinable on August 1, 1986, that are payable to the individual under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) (QDRO).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1986-08-01 | The portion of any distribution made after August 1, 1986, that is treated as a recovery of a grandfather amount depends on which of two grandfather recovery methods the individual elects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|            |             (2) The relevant policies, certificates, contracts of insurance, or plan documents disclose in a prominent and effective manner that employers, employee organizations, or plan sponsors, as applicable, are required to notify the issuer (or multiemployer plan) if the contribution rate changes at any point during the plan year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
