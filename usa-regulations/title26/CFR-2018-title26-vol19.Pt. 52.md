| (8220.0, 'GBP') | The term &#8220;pound&#8221; means a unit of weight that is equal to 16 avoirdupois ounces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| (1.0, 'USD')    | The term adjusted tax means the tax that would be imposed under section 468l on the ODCs used as materials in the manufacture of such product if such ODCs were sold in the United States and the base tax amount were $1.00.                                                                               |
| (30.0, 'GBP')   | Thus, the tax may apply to an ODC whether it is in a 14-ounce can or a 30-pound tank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (400.0, 'GBP')  | In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1990 or 1992, a person is liable for the tax only if, on the date the tax is imposed, the person holds at least 400 pounds of post-1989 ODCs that are not described in paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax. |
| (400.0, 'GBP')  | In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1991, a person is liable for the tax only if, on such date, the person holds at least 400 pounds of ODCs subject to the 1991 floor stocks tax.                                                                                                    |
| (400.0, 'GBP')  | In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1993, a person is liable for the tax only if, on such date, the person holds at least 400 pounds of ODCs that are not described in paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax.                                     |
