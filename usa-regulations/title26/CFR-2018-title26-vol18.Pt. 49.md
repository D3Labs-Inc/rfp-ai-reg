# ID

 CFR-2018-title26-vol18.Pt. 49


# Summary

(1) Except as an exemption may otherwise be specifically provided for in this part, where, under the provisions of a contract, dispatches, messages, or conversations are transmitted by telephone, radio telephone, telegraph, cable, or radio in consideration of the payment of a lump sum of money or the performance of services, the amounts paid for such transmissions are subject to tax regardless of whether such dispatches, messages, or conversations relate to the operation of the business of a common carrier and whether they are &#8220;on line&#8221; or &#8220;off line&#8221;.
In any case where a payment for the United States portion is not subject to tax under the rules set forth in this section, the carrier furnishing transportation for the United States portion shall procure and maintain appropriate evidence which will clearly show that the tickets or orders for such transportation were purchased for use in conjunction with connecting transportation from or to a point outside the United States.

|             |               (i) Where the transportation within the United States involves one stop, the scheduled interval between the beginning or end of the United States portion of such air transportation and the end or beginning of the remainder of the air transportation, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|             |               (ii) Where the United States portion of such transportation involves two or more stops, the scheduled interval between the beginning or end of one segment and the end or beginning of the continuing segment of such portion does not exceed six hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 6 hour      | The transportation is considered to be entirely by air even though the passenger may use other means of transportation between two airports provided the scheduled six-hour limitation for his continuing air transportation is complied with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6 hour      | (2) Where the interval between arrival and departure time at any stopover point in the United States exceeds six hours, such transportation is not uninterrupted international air transportation even though the schedules of the air lines do not make possible a scheduling within the six-hour limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6 hour      | (2) Where the interval between arrival and departure time at any stopover point in the United States exceeds six hours, such transportation is not uninterrupted international air transportation even though the schedules of the air lines do not make possible a scheduling within the six-hour limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6 hour      | Where any interval scheduled for six hours or less is increased to exceed six hours, the transportation will continue to be uninterrupted international air transportation if the increase in time is attributable to delays in the arrival or departure of the scheduled air transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6 hour      | Where any interval scheduled for six hours or less is increased to exceed six hours, the transportation will continue to be uninterrupted international air transportation if the increase in time is attributable to delays in the arrival or departure of the scheduled air transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6.0 hour    | However, if for any other reason such interval at any stopover is increased to more than 6 hours, the transportation will lose its classification of uninterrupted international air transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6 hour      | For example, where transportation by air from Chicago to New York only is scheduled in Chicago and transportation by air from New York to London, England, is scheduled by the passenger after his arrival in New York, the Chicago to New York trip does not qualify as uninterrupted international air transportation even though the passenger may depart on the London flight within six hours after arrival in New York.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1 month     | Amounts paid for commutation tickets or books for one month or less are exempt from the tax regardless of the distance of a single trip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 90.0 day    | If the redemption value of the unused ticket or order (or portion thereof) is less than the amount of the tax due on the amount paid for the travel actually performed, the person redeeming the unused ticket or order (or portion thereof) shall make no refund but shall apply the entire amount against the tax due and shall collect any additional tax due or, within 90 days, shall make a report of the amount of the tax remaining uncollected, together with the name and address of the person who sought the refund.                                                                                                    |
| 90.0 day    | In the event that the redemption value of the unused Calgary to Edmonton ticket is less than the amount of the tax due on the amount paid for the transportation from Seattle to Calgary, the carrier should not make any refund but should apply against the outstanding tax the entire amount refundable and should either collect the balance of the tax due or make a report, within 90 days, to the office of the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the carrier is located, setting forth the name and address of the person seeking the refund and the amount of the tax remaining uncollected. |
| 30.0 day    | The payment of tax shall be made to the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the taxpayer resides, or to the person from whom the transportation was purchased, within 30 days after whichever of the following first occurs: (a) The rights to the transportation expire, or (b) the transportation becomes subject to tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.0 year    | Such person shall retain the duplicate with the shipping papers for at least 3 years from the last day of the month during which the shipment was made from the point of origin, and shall file the original with the carrier at the time of payment of the transportation charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3.0 year    | The carrier receiving the original certificate shall retain it along with the document showing payment of the transportation charge, for a period of at least 3 years from the last day of the month during which the shipment was made from the point of origin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
