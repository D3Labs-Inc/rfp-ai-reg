# Title

 Animals and Animal Products. PART 441â€”CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS: RAW PRODUCTS


# ID

 CFR-2018-title9-vol2.Pt. 441


# Summary

(a) Raw livestock, poultry, and fish carcasses and parts will not be permitted to retain water resulting from post-evisceration processing unless the establishment preparing those carcasses and parts demonstrates to FSIS, with data collected in accordance with a written protocol, that any water retained in the carcasses or parts is an unavoidable consequence of the process used to meet applicable food safety requirements.
The primary purpose of the protocol should be to determine the amount or percentage of water absorption and retention that is unavoidable using a particular chilling system while achieving the regulatory pathogen reduction performance standard for Salmonella as set forth in the PR/HACCP regulations (9 CFR 310.25(b), 381.94(b)) and the time/temperature requirements set forth in 9 CFR 381.66.
Any post-evisceration washing or chilling processes that affect water retention levels in and microbial loads on raw products should be described.
The protocol should detail the testing methods to be used both for measuring water absorption and retention and for sampling and testing product for pathogen reductions.
The protocol should call for water retention and pathogen reduction tests at various chilling equipment settings and chilling time-and-temperature combinations.
