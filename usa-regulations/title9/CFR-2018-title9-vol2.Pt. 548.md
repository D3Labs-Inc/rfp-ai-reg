 CFR-2018-title9-vol2.Pt. 548


# Summary

(a) All processes used in preparing any fish product in official establishments shall be subject to inspection by Program employees unless such preparation is conducted as or consists of operations that are exempted from inspection under 9 CFR 303.1.
To carry out this responsibility effectively, the operator of the establishment shall institute appropriate measures to ensure the maintenance of the establishment and the preparation, marking, labeling, packaging and other handling of its products strictly in accordance with the sanitary and other requirements of this subchapter.
Requirements concerning ingredients and other articles used in the preparation of fish products.
All ingredients and other articles used in the preparation of any fish product must be clean, sound, healthful, wholesome, and otherwise such as will not result in the product's being adulterated.
Samples of products, water, dyes, chemicals, preservatives, spices, or other articles in any official establishment shall be taken, without cost to the Program, for examination, as often as may be deemed necessary for the efficient conduct of the inspection.
A non-Federal analytical laboratory that has met the requirements for accreditation specified in 9 CFR part 439 and hence, at an establishment's discretion, may be used in lieu of an FSIS laboratory for analyzing official regulatory samples.
