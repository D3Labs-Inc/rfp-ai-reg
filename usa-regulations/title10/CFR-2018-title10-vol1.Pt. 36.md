| 1993-07-01 | (b) For licenses initially issued after July 1, 1993, irradiator pools must have no outlets more than 0.5 meter below the normal low water level that could allow water to drain out of the pool.                                           |
| 1993-07-01 | Irradiators whose construction begins after July 1, 1993, must meet the design requirements of this section.                                                                                                                                |
