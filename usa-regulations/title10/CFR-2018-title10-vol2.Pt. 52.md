| 180.0 day  | Not less than 180 days before the date scheduled for initial loading of fuel into a plant by a licensee that has been issued a combined license under this part, the Commission shall publish notice of intended operation in the Federal Register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 60.0 day   | The notice must provide that any person whose interest may be affected by operation of the plant may, within 60 days, request that the Commission hold a hearing on whether the facility as constructed complies, or on completion will comply, with the acceptance criteria in the combined license, except that a hearing shall not be granted for those ITAAC which the Commission found were met under &#167;&#8201;52.97(a)(2).                                                                                                                                          |
| 180.0 day  | (e) The Commission shall, to the maximum possible extent, render a decision on issues raised by the hearing request within 180 days of the publication of the notice provided by paragraph (a) of this section or by the anticipated date for initial loading of fuel into the reactor, whichever is later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 40.0 year  | A combined license is issued for a specified period not to exceed 40 years from the date on which the Commission makes a finding that acceptance criteria are met under &#167;&#8201;52.103(g) or allowing operation during an interim period under the combined license under &#167;&#8201;52.103(c).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30.0 day   | (a)(1) When a licensee has determined to permanently cease operations the licensee shall, within 30 days, submit a written certification to the NRC, consistent with the requirements of &#167;&#8201;52.3(b)(8);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |             (2) Once fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel, the licensee shall submit a written certification to the NRC that meets the requirements of &#167;&#8201;52.3(b)(9); and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |             (3) For licensees whose licenses have been permanently modified to allow possession but not operation of the facility, before September 27, 2007, the certification required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be deemed to have been submitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 60.0 year  | (c) Decommissioning will be completed within 60 years of permanent cessation of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 60.0 year  | Completion of decommissioning beyond 60 years will be approved by the Commission only when necessary to protect public health and safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 60.0 year  | Factors that will be considered by the Commission in evaluating an alternative that provides for completion of decommissioning beyond 60 years of permanent cessation of operations include unavailability of waste disposal capacity and other site-specific factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out decommissioning, including presence of other nuclear facilities at the site.                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 90.0 day   | (e) Licensees shall not perform any major decommissioning activities, as defined in &#167;&#8201;50.2 of this chapter, until 90 days after the NRC has received the licensee's PSDAR submittal and until certifications of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel, as required under &#167;&#8201;52.110(a)(1), have been submitted.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 90.0 day   | For licensees that have submitted the certifications required under &#167;&#8201;52.110(a) and commencing 90 days after the NRC has received the PSDAR, an additional 20 percent may be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
