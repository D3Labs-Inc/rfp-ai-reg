|            |               (1) In cases where no partial decision on the relative merits of the proposed site and alternative sites under subpart A of part 51 is requested, upon determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that further review would identify one or more preferable alternative sites and the partial decision on one or more site suitability issues would lead to an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources prior to the submittal of the remainder of the information required by &#167;&#8201;50.30(f) of this chapter that would prejudice the later review and decision on such alternative sites; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|            |               (iii) The possible effect on the public interest and the parties of having an early, if not necessarily conclusive, resolution of those issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 5.0 year   | (2) Following either the Commission (acting in the function of a presiding officer) issuance of a partial initial decision, or completion of Commission review of the partial initial decision of the presiding officer, after hearing, on the site suitability issues, the partial decision shall remain in effect either for a period of 5 years or, where the applicant for the combined license has made timely submittal of the information required to support the application as provided in &#167;&#8201;2.101(a-2), until the proceeding for a combined license on the site identified in the partial decision has been concluded, unless the Commission or presiding officer, upon its own initiative or upon motion by a party to the proceeding, finds that there exists significant new information that substantially affects the earlier conclusions and reopens the hearing record on site suitability issues. |
| 5.0 year   | Upon good cause shown, the Commission may extend the 5-year period during which a partial decision shall remain in effect for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 1 year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
