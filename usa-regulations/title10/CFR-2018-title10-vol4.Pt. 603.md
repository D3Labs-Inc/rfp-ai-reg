| (5000.0, 'USD')   | The contracting officer may accept the full value of a donated capital asset if the real property or equipment is to be dedicated to the project and the contracting officer expects that it will have a fair market value that is less than $5,000 at the project's end.                                                                             |
| (800000.0, 'USD') | (b) To illustrate the approach, consider a project for which the contracting officer is confident that the recipient will have to expend at least $800,000 to achieve the specified outcomes.                                                                                                                                                         |
| (320000.0, 'USD') | In that case, the Federal share should be no more than 40% and the contracting officer could set a fixed level of Federal support at $320,000 (40% of $800,000).                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| (500000.0, 'USD') | (b) For each other for-profit participant, the contracting officer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                   |                 (1) Should require that the participant have an independent auditor (i.e., the DCAA or an independent public accountant (IPA)) conduct periodic audits of its systems if it expends $500,000 or more per year in TIAs and other Federal assistance awards.                                                                            |
| (5000.0, 'USD')   | The two circumstances, which should be infrequent for equipment and extremely rare for real property, are those in which either:                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                   |                 (1) The real property or equipment will be dedicated to the project and has a current fair market value that is less than $5,000 by the time the project ends; or                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                   |                 (2) The contracting officer gives prior approval for the firm to include the full acquisition cost of the real property or equipment as part of the cost of the project (see &#167;&#8201;603.535).                                                                                                                                   |
| (5000.0, 'USD')   | A TIA, whether it is a fixed-support or expenditure-based award, must specify that any item of equipment that has a fair market value of $5,000 or more at the conclusion of the project also will be subject to the disposition process in 10 CFR 600.321(f), whereby the Federal Government will recover its interest in the property at that time. |
| (120000.0, 'USD') | If an expenditure-based TIA provides for either advance payments or payable milestones, the agreement must require the recipient to:                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                   |                 (a) Maintain in an interest-bearing account any advance payments or milestone payment amounts received in advance of needs to disburse the funds for program purposes unless:                                                                                                                                                         |
|                   |                 (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and TIAs per year;                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                   |                 (2) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $1,000 per year on the advance or milestone payments; or                                                                                                                                                               |
|                   |                 (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources for the project.                                                                                                                                                      |

| 1974-10-01 | Generally, elements of cost that appropriately are charged are those identified with RD&amp;D activities under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (see Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 2, &#8220;Accounting for Research and Development Costs,&#8221; October 1974).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-03-01 | A TIA's patent rights provision should include the Bayh-Dole march-in rights set out in paragraph (j) of the Patent Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organization) provision in Appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR 600, or an equivalent clause, concerning actions that the Government may take to obtain the right to use subject inventions, if the recipient fails to take effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject inventions within a reasonable time. |
| 2018-03-01 | The march-in provision may be modified to best meet the needs of the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2018-03-01 | However, only infrequently should the march-in provision be entirely removed (e.g., if a recipient is providing most of the funding for a RD&amp;D project, with the Government providing a much smaller share).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
