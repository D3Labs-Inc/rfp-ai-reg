| 60.0 day   | (3) Notice of the selection of a prospective licensee to be granted a limited exclusive license of a specified duration and scope shall have been transmitted to the Attorney General of the United States and shall have been published for at least sixty (60) days in the Federal Register with a statement advising of the rights of license applicants or third parties to apply for nonexclusive licenses or bring information to the attention of the Commission under the next paragraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 60.0 day   | (4) After expiration of the period in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Commission has determined (i) that no applicant for a nonexclusive license has brought or will bring the invention to the point of practical application as specified in the prospective exclusive license within a reasonable period under a nonexclusive license, and (ii) that the granting of the license would be in the public interest and not be inconsistent with the Act after consideration of all the facts and any written evidence and argument which third parties may present to the Commission within sixty (60) days of the publication of the notices of the selection of the licensee under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 5.0 year   | (2) The duration of the license will be negotiated and shall include (i) a period of exclusivity specified in the license, which shall be related to the period necessary to provide a reasonable incentive for the licensee to invest the necessary risk capital to bring the invention to the point of practical application and which shall not exceed 5 years or be extended unless the Commission determines on the basis of a written submission supported by a factual showing that a longer period is reasonably necessary to permit the licensee to enter the market and recoup his investment in bringing the invention to the point of practical application; and (ii) a terminal portion, sufficient to make the invention reasonably available for the granting of nonexclusive licenses under &#167;&#8201;81.20, during which the licensee may have a nonexclusive license if the licensee continues to make the invention reasonably accessible to the public. |
| 30.0 day   | (12) Before modifying or revoking any license granted pursuant to this subpart for any cause, the Commission shall mail to the licensee and any sublicensee of record at the last address filed with the Commission a written notice of the Commission's intention to modify or revoke the license, and the licensee and any sublicensee shall be allowed thirty (30) days after the mailing of such notice, or within such period as may be granted by the Commission, to remedy any breach of any covenant or agreement referred to in paragraph (a)(11)(iv) of this section or to show cause why the license should not be modified or revoked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day   | An applicant for a license, a licensee, or a third party who has participated under &#167;&#8201;81.30(a)(3) shall have the right to appeal in accordance with the appeal procedures of this subpart any decision of the Commission concerning the grant, denial, interpretation, modification, or revocation of a license under this subpart, by filing a notice of appeal with the Commission within thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of a notice by the Commission of the decision or, if no such notice to the person desiring to appeal, then thirty (30) days from publication in the Federal Register of the facts which show such a decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
