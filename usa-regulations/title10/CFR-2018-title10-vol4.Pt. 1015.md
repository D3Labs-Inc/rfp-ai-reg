| (100000.0, 'USD')  | (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the DOJ.                                                                                                                                                       |

| (100000.0, 'USD')  | (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the DOJ.                                                                                                                  |
| (100000.0, 'USD')  | If DOE believes that suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, DOE shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the DOJ, using the CCLR.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
