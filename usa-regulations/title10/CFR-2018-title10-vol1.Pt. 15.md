|            |             (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            |             (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |             (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of the debt with interest at a later date.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1 year     | Debts will be referred as early as possible, consistent with the NRC's aggressive collection activity and well within the one year of the NRC's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
