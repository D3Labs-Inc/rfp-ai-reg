| 5.0 year   | (b) At two 5-year intervals after the effective date of the extension to existing customers, Western shall create a project-specific resource pool increment of up to an additional 1 percent of the long-term marketable resource under contract at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 5.0 year   | (d) The formula set forth in paragraph (a) of this section also should be used to determine the amounts of firm power subject to withdrawal at 5-year intervals after the effective date of the extension to existing customers, except that the percentage used would be up to 1 percent for each of the two withdrawal opportunities, and the formula would use the customer CROD, project CROD and the resource under contract at the time. |
| 5.0 year   | Under contracts that extend resources under this PMI, existing customers shall be given at least 5 years' notice before adjustments are made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
