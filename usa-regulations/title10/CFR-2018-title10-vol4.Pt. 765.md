| 2007-12-31 | A failure by a licensee to receive approval from the Department of a plan prior to December 31, 2007 will preclude that licensee from receiving any reimbursement for costs of remedial action incurred after that date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2007-12-31 | This resulting sum will be adjusted after the approval of claims for work performed through December 31, 2007, to reflect the actual approved costs of work performed through that date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2008-12-31 | (a) No later than December 31, 2008, the Department shall determine if the aggregate amount authorized for appropriation pursuant to section 1003 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-2), as adjusted for inflation pursuant to &#167;&#8201;765.12, exceed as of that date the combined total of all reimbursements which have been paid to licensees under this part, any amounts approved for reimbursement and owed to any licensee, and any anticipated additional reimbursements to be made in accordance with approved plans for subsequent remedial action. |
