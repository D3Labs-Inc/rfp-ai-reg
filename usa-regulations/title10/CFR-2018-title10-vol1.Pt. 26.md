| 3.0 day     | The MRO shall have the ability to receive the donor's calls at all times during the 3-day period (e.g., by use of an answering machine with a &#8220;time stamp&#8221; feature when there is no one in the MRO's office to answer the phone).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3.0 day     | (4) If the donor has not requested a retest of an aliquot of a single specimen or a test of the split specimen (Bottle B) within 3 business days, the donor may present to the MRO information documenting that serious injury, illness, lack of actual notice of the confirmed test result, inability to contact the MRO (e.g., there was no one in the MRO's office and the answering machine was not working), or other circumstances unavoidably prevented the donor from making a timely request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.0 day     | If the MRO concludes from the donor's information that there was a legitimate reason for the donor's failure to contact the MRO within the 3 business days permitted, the MRO shall direct the retesting of an aliquot of the single specimen or the test of the split specimen (Bottle B) take place, as if the donor had made a timely request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1.0 day     | (5) As soon as reasonably practical and not more than 1 business day following the day of the donor's request, as permitted in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section, the MRO shall ensure that the HHS-certified laboratory forwards an aliquot of a single specimen, or that the HHS-certified laboratory (or licensee testing facility, as appropriate) forwards Bottle B of a split specimen, to a second HHS-certified laboratory that did not test the specimen in Bottle A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 90.0 day    | (1) During the initial 90-day period of any contract with an HHS-certified laboratory (not including rewritten or renewed contracts), each licensee or other entity shall submit blind performance test samples to each HHS-certified laboratory with whom it contracts in the amount of at least 20 percent of the total number of specimens submitted (up to a maximum of 100 blind performance test samples) or 30 blind performance test samples, whichever is greater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 90.0 day    | (2) Following the initial 90-day period, the number of blind performance test samples submitted per quarter must be a minimum of one percent of all specimens (up to a maximum of 100) or ten blind performance test samples, whichever is greater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 90.0 day    | (3) Both during the initial 90-day period and quarterly thereafter, licensees and other entities should attempt to submit blind performance test samples at a frequency that corresponds to the submission frequency for other specimens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2 quarter   | (b) Approximately 60 percent of the blind performance test samples submitted to the laboratory must be positive for one or more drugs or drug metabolites per sample and submitted so that all of the drugs for which the FFD program is testing are included at least once each calendar quarter, except as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|             |             (1) Licensees and other entities shall submit blind performance test samples that are positive for marijuana metabolite at least two times each quarter; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|             |             (2) In at least two quarters each year, licensees and other entities shall submit an additional blind performance test sample that is positive for cocaine instead of the required sample that is positive for PCP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|             |             (1) Ensure that all blind performance test sample lots are placed in service by the supplier only after confirmation by an HHS-certified laboratory, and for no more than 6 months;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|             |             (2) Ensure that the supplier provides the expiration date for each blind performance test sample to ensure that each sample will have the expected value when it is submitted to and tested by a laboratory; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
