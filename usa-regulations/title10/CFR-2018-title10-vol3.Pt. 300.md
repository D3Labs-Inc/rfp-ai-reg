| 4 year     | (5) An entity that does not intend to register emissions may report emission inventories for any year back to 1990 and may report emission reductions for any year back to 1991, relative to a base period of one to four years, ending no earlier than 1990.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3 year     | DOE intends periodically to review the General Guidelines and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see &#167;&#8201;300.13) to determine whether any changes are warranted; DOE anticipates these reviews will occur approximately once every three years.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4.0 year   | Base period means a period of 1-4 years used to derive the average annual base emissions, emissions intensity or other values from which emission reductions are calculated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1 year     | First reduction year means the first year for which an entity intends to register emission reductions; it is the year that immediately follows the start year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1 year     | (1) For all entities, it is the year immediately preceding the first year for which the entity intends to register emission reductions and the last year of the initial base period(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1 year     | (i) For a large emitter, the start year is the first year for which the entity submits a complete emissions inventory under the 1605(b) program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4 year     | (ii) The entity's emissions in its start year or its average annual emissions over a period of up to four years ending in the start year determine whether it qualifies to begin reporting as a small emitter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4 year     | To demonstrate that its annual emissions are less than or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, an entity must submit either an estimate of its emissions during its chosen start year or an estimate of its average annual emissions over a continuous period not to exceed four years of time ending in its chosen start year, as long as the operations and boundaries of the entity have not changed significantly during that period. |
| 5 year     | A new estimate of total emissions must be submitted after any significant increase in emissions, any change in the operations or boundaries of the small emitter, or every five years, whichever occurs first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5 year     | (2) After starting to report, each reporting entity that excludes from its annual reports any de minimis emissions must re-estimate the quantity of excluded emissions after any significant increase in such emissions, or every five years, whichever occurs sooner.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1 year     | For example, if an entity achieved a net emission reduction of 5,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in its first year, a net increase of 2,000 metric tons in its second year, and a net reduction of 3,000 metric tons in its third year, it would be able to register a 5,000 metric ton reduction in its first year, no reduction in its second year, and a 1,000 metric ton reduction in its third year (3,000-2,000).                           |
| 2 year     | For example, if an entity achieved a net emission reduction of 5,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in its first year, a net increase of 2,000 metric tons in its second year, and a net reduction of 3,000 metric tons in its third year, it would be able to register a 5,000 metric ton reduction in its first year, no reduction in its second year, and a 1,000 metric ton reduction in its third year (3,000-2,000).                           |
| 3 year     | For example, if an entity achieved a net emission reduction of 5,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in its first year, a net increase of 2,000 metric tons in its second year, and a net reduction of 3,000 metric tons in its third year, it would be able to register a 5,000 metric ton reduction in its first year, no reduction in its second year, and a 1,000 metric ton reduction in its third year (3,000-2,000).                           |

| 3 year     | The entity must file full reports for each of these three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2 year     | Its report for the second year would indicate the net increase in emissions and this increase would be noted in EIA's summary of the entity's report for that year and for any future year, until the emissions increase was entirely offset by subsequent emission reductions.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3 year     | If this same entity achieved a net reduction of only 1,000 metric tons in its third year, it would not be able to register additional reductions until it had, in some future year, offset more than its second year increase of 2,000 metric tons.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 4 year     | In general, the base period used in calculating emission reductions is the single year or up to four-year period average immediately preceding the first year of calculated emission reductions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
