| 4 month    | As a minimum, low level discharge facilities will be sized to reduce the pool, within a period of four months, to the higher of the following pool levels: (1) A pool level that is within 20 feet of the pre-project &#8220;full channel&#8221; elevation, or (2) a pool level which will result in an amount of storage in the reservoir that is 10 percent of that at the beginning pool level. |
| 4 month    | The drawdown period inflow will then be assumed equivalent to the average flow of the highest consecutive four-month period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
