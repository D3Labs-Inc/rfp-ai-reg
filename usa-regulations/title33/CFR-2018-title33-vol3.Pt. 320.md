| 1960-06-27 | The concern of Congress for the preservation of significant historical sites is also expressed in the Preservation of Historical and Archeological Data Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469 et seq.), which amends the Act of June 27, 1960.                                                                                                                  |
| 1977-05-24 | For projects to be undertaken or partially or entirely funded by a federal, state, or local agency, additional requirements on wetlands considerations are stated in Executive Order 11990, dated 24 May 1977.                                                                                                                                       |
| 1970-05-27 | Because harbor lines were established on the basis of navigation impacts only, the Corps of Engineers published a regulation on 27 May 1970 (33 CFR 209.150) which declared that permits would thereafter be required for activities shoreward of the harbor lines.                                                                                  |
| 1970-05-27 | Accordingly, activities constructed shoreward of harbor lines prior to 27 May 1970 do not require specific authorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
