| 15.0 day   | (2) Within 15 days of receipt of an application the district engineer will either determine that the application is complete (see 33 CFR 325.1(d)(9) and issue a public notice as described in &#167;&#8201;325.3 of this part, unless specifically exempted by other provisions of this regulation or that it is incomplete and notify the applicant of the information necessary for a complete application.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30.0 day   | The district engineer should not delay processing of the application unless the applicant requests a reasonable delay, normally not to exceed 30 days, to provide additional information or comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30.0 day   | If such notice or a request for supplemental information is not received within 30 days of issuance of the public notice, the district engineer will assume EPA has made a negative determination with respect to section 401(a)(2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 60.0 day   | If EPA determines another state's waters may be affected, such state has 60 days from receipt of EPA's notice to determine if the proposed discharge will affect the quality of its waters so as to violate any water quality requirement in such state, to notify EPA and the district engineer in writing of its objection to permit issuance, and to request a public hearing.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 60 day     | A waiver may be explicit, or will be deemed to occur if the certifying agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification within sixty days after receipt of such a request unless the district engineer determines a shorter or longer period is reasonable for the state to act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 60 day     | Similarly, if it appears that circumstances may reasonably require a period of time longer than sixty days, the district engineer, based on information provided by the certifying agency, will determine a longer reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, at which time a waiver will be deemed to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1 year     | Similarly, if it appears that circumstances may reasonably require a period of time longer than sixty days, the district engineer, based on information provided by the certifying agency, will determine a longer reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, at which time a waiver will be deemed to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6 month    | If the state agency fails to concur or object to a certification statement within six months of the state agency's receipt of the certification statement, state agency concurrence with the certification statement shall be conclusively presumed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 15.0 day   | The district engineer will be guided by the following time limits for the indicated steps in the evaluation process:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 30.0 day   | Before designating comment periods less than 30 days, the district engineer will consider: (i) Whether the proposal is routine or noncontroversial,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
