| 5 year      | Any person disclosing information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, if a violation is suspected or a violation is discovered, conduct a thorough review of all export transactions for the past five years where violations of the FTR are suspected and notify the Census Bureau as soon as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5 year      | The Census Bureau recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5 year      | If the review goes back less than five years, there is a risk that violations may not be discovered that later could become the subject of an investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
