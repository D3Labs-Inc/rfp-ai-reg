| 90.0 day   | If a State agency objects to a negative determination, asserting that coastal effects are reasonably foreseeable, the Federal agency shall consider submitting a consistency determination to the State agency or otherwise attempt to resolve any disagreement within the remainder of the 90-day period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 90.0 day   | (2) Federal and State agencies may mutually agree upon procedures for extending the notification requirement beyond 90 days for activities requiring a substantial review period, and for shortening the notification period for activities requiring a less extensive review period, provided that public participation requirements are met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 120.0 day  | In these cases the consistency determination must be made by the Federal agency at the earliest practicable time following management program approval, and the State agency must be provided with a consistency determination no later than 120 days after management program approval for ongoing activities which the State agency lists or identifies through monitoring as subject to consistency with the management program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 90.0 day   | Where the Federal agency is not aware of any inconsistency until after submission of its consistency determination, the Federal agency shall submit its description of the legal authority that prohibits full consistency to the State agency as soon as possible, or before the end of the 90-day period described in &#167;&#8201;930.36(b)(1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 90.0 day   | In either case, the consistency determination shall be transmitted to the State agency at least 90 days before final decisions are taken by any of the participating agencies and shall comply with the requirements of &#167;&#8201;930.39.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 60.0 day   | The Federal agency may presume State agency concurrence if the State agency's response is not received within 60 days from receipt of the Federal agency's consistency determination and supporting information required by &#167;&#8201;930.39(a).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 14.0 day   | If the information required by &#167;&#8201;930.39(a) is not included with the determination, the State agency shall notify the Federal agency in writing within 14 days of receiving the determination and supporting information that the 60-day review period has not begun, identify missing information required by &#167;&#8201;930.39(a), and that the 60-day review period will begin when the missing information is received by the State agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
