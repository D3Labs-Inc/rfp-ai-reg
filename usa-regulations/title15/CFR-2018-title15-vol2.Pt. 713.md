| 3 year     | (B) In order to trigger a declaration requirement for a past activity (i.e., production, processing or consumption) involving a Schedule 2 chemical, a plant on your plant site must have exceeded the applicable declaration threshold for that particular activity during one or more of the previous three calendar years.                                                                                                                             |
| 3 year     | However, a declaration requirement would apply if an activity involving a Schedule 2 chemical at the plant exceeded the declaration threshold in an earlier year (i.e., during the course of any other calendar year within the past three calendar years), as indicated in the example provided in the note to this paragraph.                                                                                                                           |
| 3 year     | For example, if a plant on your plant site produced a Schedule 2 chemical in an amount greater than the applicable declaration threshold during the previous calendar year, you would have to declare only the production quantity from that plant, provided that the total amount of the Schedule 2 chemical processed or consumed at the plant did not exceed the applicable declaration threshold during any one of the previous three calendar years. |
| 3 month    | (1) You must declare additionally planned production, processing, or consumption of Schedule 2 chemicals after the annual declaration on anticipated activities for the next calendar year has been delivered to BIS if:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 2018-12-01 | (ii) For the purpose of determining if a Schedule 2 chemical is subject to declaration, you must declare an intermediate Schedule 2 chemical, but not a transient intermediate Schedule 2 chemical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
