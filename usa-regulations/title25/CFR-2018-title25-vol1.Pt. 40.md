# ID

 CFR-2018-title25-vol1.Pt. 40


# Summary

Funds appropriated by Congress for the education of Indians may be used for making educational loans and grants to aid students of one-fourth or more degree of Indian blood attending accredited institutions of higher education or other accredited schools offering vocational and technical training who reside within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or on trust or restricted lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Such educational loans and grants may be made also to students of one-fourth or more degree of Indian blood who reside near the reservation when a denial of such loans or grants would have a direct effect upon Bureau programs within the reservation.
Working scholarships may be granted to Indians who wish to earn their board and room by part-time work at Federal boarding schools that are located near a college, trade, or vocational school.
Applications for educational loans, grants, and working scholarships shall be submitted through the superintendent or officer in charge of the agency at which the applicant is enrolled in the manner prescribed by the Commissioner.
If a borrower or cosigner has security to offer for an educational loan it must be given in an amount adequate to protect the loan.
