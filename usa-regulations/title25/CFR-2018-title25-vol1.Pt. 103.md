| 45.0 day    | If the lender fails to send BIA a notice changing its choice of remedy and does not finalize an approved loan modification agreement within the 45-day period (or any extension thereof), the lender's only permissible remedy under the Program will be to pursue the procedure specified in &#167;&#8201;103.36(d)(2).                                                                                                                   |
| 90.0 day    | (e) Failure by the lender to provide BIA with notice of the lender's election of remedy within 90 calendar days of the default, as indicated in &#167;&#8201;103.36(d), will invalidate BIA's loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage for that particular loan, absent an express waiver of this provision by BIA.                                                                                                                 |
| 90.0 day    | (1) If the lender makes an immediate claim under &#167;&#8201;103.36(d)(1), it must send BIA the claim for loss within 90 calendar days of the default by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required).                                                                                                                                           |
| 30.0 day    | (2) If the lender elects first to liquidate the collateral securing the loan under &#167;&#8201;103.36(d)(2), and has a residual loss after doing so, it must send BIA the claim for loss within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
