# Title

 Indians. PART 1001â€”SELF-GOVERNANCE PROGRAM


# ID

 CFR-2018-title25-vol2.Pt. 1001


# Summary

If appropriated funds are available but insufficient to meet the total requests from tribes/consortia, we will give first priority to those that have been selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an annual funding agreement.
Each year, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register which provides relevant details about the application process, including: The funds available, timeframes, and requirements for negotiation and advance planning specified in this part.
Any tribe/consortium that has been accepted into the applicant pool in accordance with &#167;&#8201;1001.5 and has been selected to negotiate a self-governance annual funding agreement is eligible to apply for a negotiation grant.
Any tribe/consortium that is not a self-governance tribe and needs advance funding in order to complete the planning phase requirement may apply.
(b) Are there other funds that may be available to self-governance tribes/consortia for planning and negotiating with DOI non-BIA bureaus?
Yes. Tribes/consortia may contact the Director, Office of Self-Governance to determine if funds are available for the purpose of planning and negotiating with DOI non-BIA bureaus under this section.
(g) What criteria will we use to award grants to those tribes/consortia requesting financial assistance to plan and negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program?
