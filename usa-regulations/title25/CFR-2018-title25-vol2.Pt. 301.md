# Summary

Subject to the detailed requirements that follow, the Government stamp shall be affixed only to work individually produced and to work entirely hand-made.
No object produced under conditions resembling a bench work system, and no object in whose manufacture any power-driven machinery has been used, shall be eligible for the use of the Government stamp.
Silver slugs of 1 ounce weight or other silver objects may be used, provided their fineness is at least 900, and provided further that no silver sheet shall be used.
The only exceptions here are pins on brooches or similar objects; ear screws for earrings; backs for tie clasps and chains which may be of silver of different fineness and mechanically made.
Specifications of dies.
Dies used are to be entirely hand-made, with no tools more mechanical than hand tools and vise.
Dies shall contain only a single element of the design.
Dies are to be applied to the object with the aid of nothing except hand tools.
These requirements apply to the boxes for stone used in the design.
In addition to turquoise, the use of other local stone is permitted.
All stone used, including turquoise, is to be hand-cut and polished.
This permits the use of hand- or foot-driven wheels.
