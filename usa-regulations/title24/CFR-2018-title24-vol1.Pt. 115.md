| 12.0 month | (2) The amount of funding to agencies that are new to contributions funding will be based on the number of complaints acceptably processed by the agency during the specifically identified 12-month period preceding the signing of the cooperative agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
