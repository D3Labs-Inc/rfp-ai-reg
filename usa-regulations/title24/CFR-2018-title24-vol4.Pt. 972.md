| 6 month    | PHAs are not required to undertake conversions under this subpart until six months after the effective date of the cost methodology, which will be announced in the Federal Register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5.0 year   | The revitalization cost estimate used in the PHA's most recent Annual Plan or 5-Year Plan is to be used for this purpose, unless the PHA demonstrates, or HUD determines, that another cost estimate is clearly more realistic to ensure viability and to sustain the operating costs that are described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|            |                 (A) The development must be removed from the public housing inventory and that the family may be displaced as a result of the conversion;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|            |                 (B) The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon the relocation of the family into such housing);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |                 (C) Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or Section 8 administrative fee funding);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|            |                 (D) Such families will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |                 (E) If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing, using tenant-based assistance towards rent; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |                 (F) Where section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation, the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before displacement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 90.0 day   | (5) If the required conversion is subject to the URA, the written notice described in paragraph (b)(4) must also provide that:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            |                 (i) The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be required to move, and that the family will not be required to move permanently until the family is offered comparable housing, as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |                 (ii) Any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible for relocation payments or assistance under the URA, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as provided in the URA regulations at 49 CFR 24.208;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|            |                 (iii) The family has a right to appeal the PHA's determination as to the family's application for relocation assistance for which the family may be eligible under this subpart and URA;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5.0 year   | (c) The conversion plan may not be more than a 5-year plan, unless the PHA applies for and receives approval from HUD for a longer period of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10.0 year  | HUD may allow the PHA up to 10 years to remove the units from the inventory, in exceptional circumstances where HUD determines that this is clearly the most cost effective and beneficial means of providing housing assistance over that same period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5 year     | For example, HUD may allow a longer period of time to remove the units from the public housing inventory, where more than one development is being converted, and a larger number of families require relocation than can easily be absorbed into the rental market at one time, provided the housing has a remaining useful life of longer than five years and the longer time frame will assist in relocation.                                                                                                                                                                     |
