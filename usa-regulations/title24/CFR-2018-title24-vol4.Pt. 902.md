| 3.0 year   | All PHAs must retain supporting documents for any certifications and for asset management reviews for at least 3 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3.0 year   | Failure to maintain and provide supporting documentation for a period of 3 years for any indicator(s), subindicator(s), or other methods used to assess performance shall result in a score of zero for the indicator(s) or subindicator(s), and a lower overall PHAS score for the applicable assessment period.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
