| 20.0 year  | The owner shall not convert the units in the project to condominium ownership or to a form of cooperative ownership that is not eligible to receive a housing development grant, during the 20-year period from the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 20.0 year  | The owner shall assure that the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement is occupied, or is available for occupancy, by low-income households during the period beginning on the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy through 20 years from the date on which 50 percent of the units are occupied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 60.0 day   | Any schedule submitted by an owner within the permissible maximum will be deemed approved, unless the grantee informs the owner, within 60 days after receiving the schedule, that it is disapproved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30.0 day   | (5) Any increase in rents for low-income units is subject to the provisions of outstanding leases, in any event, the owner must provide tenants of those units not less than 30 days prior written notice before implementing any increase in rents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6 month    | (2) If this reexamination indicates that the tenant no longer qualifies as a low-income household, the owner must take one of the following actions, as appropriate: (i) If the unit occupied by the tenant must be leased to a low- income household to maintain the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement, the owner must notify the tenant that it must move when the current lease expires or six months after the date of the notification, whichever is later; (ii) If the owner can meet this percentage without the unit occupied by the tenant (for example, by designating another comparable unit as a low-income unit), the owner may continue to lease to that tenant, but is free to renegotiate the rent at the expiration of the current lease. |
| 10.0 year  | The amount to be repaid shall be reduced by 10 percent for each full year in excess of 10 years that intervened between the beginning of the term of the owner-grantee agreement and the violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
