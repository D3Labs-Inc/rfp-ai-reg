| 1 year     | (vi) The hospital may show that its financial performance would be materially improved by providing documentation of the following:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |                 (A) There are limited comparable affordable refinancing vehicles available to the hospital; and,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |                 (B) The hospital meets three of the following seven criteria:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            |                 (1) The proposed refinancing would reduce the hospital's total operating expenses by at least 0.25 percent;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            |                 (2) The interest rate of the proposed refinancing would be at least 0.5 percentage points less than the interest rate on the debt to be refinanced;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |                 (3) The interest rate on the debt that the hospital proposes to refinance has increased by at least one percentage point at any time since January 1, 2008, or is very likely to increase by at least one percentage within one year of the date of application;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |                 (4) The hospital's annual total debt service is in excess of 3.4 percent of total operating revenues, based on its most recent audited financial statement;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            |                 (5) The hospital has experienced a withdrawal or expiration of its credit enhancement facility, or the lender providing its credit enhancement facility has been downgraded, or the hospital can demonstrate that one of these events is imminent;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |                 (6) The hospital is party to bond covenants that are substantially more restrictive than the Section 242 mortgage covenants; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |                 (7) There are other circumstances that demonstrate that the hospital's financial performance would be materially improved by refinancing its existing capital debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1 year     | Also, no further request from the proposed applicant for a Preliminary Review shall be entertained for a period of one year from the date of HUD's notification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1 year     | HUD may grant an exception to this one-year limitation if, during the year, there is a major change in the circumstances that caused HUD to determine that the project would be rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1 year     | For example, if the sole reason for HUD's determination was the hospital's failure to meet the historical operating margin test, and a new audited annual financial statement contains results that would cause the hospital to meet the test, then the lender may request a new Preliminary Review within one year of HUD's notification.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1 year     | (iii) If HUD does not identify any factors that would cause an application to be rejected, HUD shall issue a Preliminary Review Letter advising the potential applicant that there appears to be no bar to the applicant's proceeding to the next step in the application process, provided that if a complete application is not received by HUD within one year following the date of HUD's letter, another Preliminary Review may be required, at HUD's discretion, before the application process may proceed.                    |
| 90.0 day   | (1) The initial commitment shall be issued for a period of 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 180.0 day  | (2) The term of a commitment may be extended in such manner as HUD may prescribe, provided, however, that the combined term of the original commitment and any extensions do not exceed 180 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30.0 day   | A commitment fee that, when added to the application fee, will aggregate $3 per thousand dollars of the amount of the loan set forth in the commitment, shall be paid within 30 days of the date of issuance of the commitment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|            |                 (A) There are limited comparable affordable refinancing vehicles available to the hospital; and,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |                 (B) The hospital meets three of the following seven criteria:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |                 (1) The proposed refinancing would reduce the hospital's total operating expenses by at least 0.25 percent;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |                 (2) The interest rate of the proposed refinancing would be at least 0.5 percentage points less than the interest rate on the debt to be refinanced;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |                 (3) The interest rate on the debt that the hospital proposes to refinance has increased by at least one percentage point at any time since January 1, 2008, or is very likely to increase by at least one percentage within one year of the date of application;                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |                 (4) The hospital's annual total debt service is in excess of 3.4 percent of total operating revenues, based on its most recent audited financial statement;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |                 (5) The hospital has experienced a withdrawal or expiration of its credit enhancement facility, or the lender providing its credit enhancement facility has been downgraded, or the hospital can demonstrate that one of these events is imminent;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            |                 (6) The hospital is party to bond covenants that are substantially more restrictive than the Section 242 mortgage covenants; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |                 (7) There are other circumstances that demonstrate that the hospital's financial performance would be materially improved by refinancing its existing capital debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
