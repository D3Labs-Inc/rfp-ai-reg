|            |               (i) The PHA's income analysis shows that the PHA has no general occupancy family developments to which the deconcentration requirements apply; that is, the average incomes of all covered developments are within the Established Income Range;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |               (ii) The PHA has covered developments with average incomes above or below the Established Income Range and the PHA provides a sufficient explanation in its Annual Plan that supports that the income mix of such development or developments is consistent with and furthers the goal of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing and also the locally determined goals of the PHA's Annual and Five Year Plans, and the PHA therefore need not take further action to deconcentrate poverty and mix incomes; or                                               |
|            |               (iii) The PHA's deconcentration policy provides specific strategies the PHA will take that can be expected to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in developments with average incomes outside of the Established Income Range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 3 year     | Notwithstanding any other regulations, a PHA may adopt site-based waiting lists where:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|            |               (i) The PHA regularly submits required occupancy data to HUD's Multifamily Tenant Characteristics Systems (MTCS) in an accurate, complete and timely manner;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (ii) The system of site-based waiting lists provides for full disclosure to each applicant of any option available to the applicant in the selection of the development in which to reside, including basic information about available sites (location, occupancy, number and size of accessible units, amenities such as day care, security, transportation and training programs) and an estimate of the period of time the applicant would likely have to wait to be admitted to units of different sizes and types (e.g., regular or accessible) at each site; |
|            |               (iii) Adoption of site-based waiting lists would not violate any court order or settlement agreement, or be inconsistent with a pending complaint brought by HUD;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |               (iv) The PHA includes reasonable measures to assure that adoption of site-based waiting lists is consistent with affirmatively furthering fair housing, such as reasonable marketing activities to attract applicants regardless of race or ethnicity;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (v) The PHA provides for review of its site-based waiting list policy to determine if the policy is consistent with civil rights laws and certifications through the following steps:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|            |               (A) As part of the submission of the Annual Plan, the PHA shall assess changes in racial, ethnic or disability-related tenant composition at each PHA site that may have occurred during the implementation of the site-based waiting list, based upon MTCS occupancy data that has been confirmed to be complete and accurate by an independent audit (which may be the annual independent audit) or is otherwise satisfactory to HUD;                                                                                                                             |
|            |               (B) At least every three years the PHA uses independent testers or other means satisfactory to HUD, to assure that the site-based waiting list is not being implemented in a discriminatory manner, and that no patterns or practices of discrimination exist, and providing the results to HUD;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |               (C) Taking any steps necessary to remedy the problems surfaced during the review; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
