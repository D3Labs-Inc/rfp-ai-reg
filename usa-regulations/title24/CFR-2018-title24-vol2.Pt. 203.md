| 90.0 day      | Regardless of its duration, a suspension to be imposed prior to February 19, 1990, will be based on a determination by the Secretary that, for mortgages insured during a specified period, the rate of monetary defaults (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) for mortgages insured under this section exceeds the rate of such monetary defaults for all insured mortgages on one- to four-family properties in the State of New York.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|            |                   (1) Temporary adverse economic conditions exist throughout the community as a direct and primary result of outstanding claims to ownership of land in the community by an American Indian tribe, band, or Nation;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |                   (2) Such ownership claims are reasonably likely to be settled, by court action or otherwise;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            |                   (3) As a direct result of the community's temporarily impaired economic condition, owners of homes in the community occupied as principal residences (as defined in &#167;&#8201;203.18(f)(1)) have been involuntarily unemployed or underemployed and have, thus, incurred substantial reductions in income that significantly impair their ability to continue timely payment of their mortgages;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 1991-02-18 | The Secretary may suspend the issuance of commitments to insure mortgages under this section, for the entire period during which commitments could otherwise be issued for insurance under this section (i.e., through February 18, 1991) or for such lesser period as the Secretary may specify, by providing thirty days notice of suspension in the Federal Register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1990-02-19 | Regardless of its duration, a suspension to be imposed prior to February 19, 1990, will be based on a determination by the Secretary that, for mortgages insured during a specified period, the rate of monetary defaults (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) for mortgages insured under this section exceeds the rate of such monetary defaults for all insured mortgages on one- to four-family properties in the State of New York.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1990-02-18 | A suspension to be imposed after February 18, 1990, will be based on a consideration by the Secretary of the probable costs to the Special Risk Insurance Fund of further commitments to insure under this section, as measured by such factors as the current and projected rate and amount of claims payments, together with other significant current and projected costs as determined by the Secretary, including a review of the actual and projected monetary default rate (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) and the actual and projected rate of lease renewal through negotiation and arbitration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
