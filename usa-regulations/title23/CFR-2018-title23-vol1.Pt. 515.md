| 30.0 day   | The State DOT must submit its implementation documentation not less than 30 days prior to the deadline for the FHWA consistency determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12.0 month | (i) FHWA considers the best evidence of plan implementation to be that, for the 12 months preceding the consistency determination, the State DOT funding allocations are reasonably consistent with the investment strategies in the State DOT's asset management plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 30.0 day   | In the event FHWA notifies a State DOT of a negative consistency determination, the State DOT has 30 days to address the deficiencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 30.0 day   | Whenever the State DOT updates or otherwise amends its asset management plan or its asset management plan development processes, the State DOT must submit the amended plan or processes to the FHWA for a new process certification and consistency determination at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the next FHWA consistency determination under paragraph (b) of this section.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18.0 month | (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the State DOT has not developed and implemented an asset management plan that is consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part and established the performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d) by the date that is 18 months after the effective date of the 23 U.S.C. 150(c) final rule for NHS pavements and bridges, the FHWA will not approve any further projects using National Highway Performance Program funds. |
