| 2004-04-14 | (a) Any analysis required by this subpart must use the FHWA Traffic Noise Model (TNM), which is described in &#8220;FHWA Traffic Noise Model&#8221; Report No. FHWA-PD-96-010, including Revision No. 1, dated April 14, 2004, or any other model determined by the FHWA to be consistent with the methodology of the FHWA TNM. |
| 1995-11-28 | (1) No funds made available out of the Highway Trust Fund may be used to construct Type II noise barriers, as defined by this regulation, if such noise barriers were not part of a project approved by the FHWA before the November 28, 1995.                                                                                  |
