| 30.0 minute  | (1) The heat release rate shall be recorded and video/photographs taken until either 30 minutes has elapsed since the start of the burner exposure or a fire develops of such size as to require suppression for the safety of the facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10.0 year    | The Commission estimates the potential total lifetime benefits of a mattress that complies with this standard to range from $45 to $57 per mattress set (based on a 10 year mattress life and a 3% discount rate).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1 year       | The Commission estimates that aggregate lifetime benefits associated with all mattresses produced the first year the standard becomes effective range from $1,024 to $1,307 million, and that aggregate resource costs associated with these mattresses range from $175 to $511 million, yielding net benefits of about $514 to $1,132 million.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10.0 minute  | The Commission considered the following alternatives: alternative maximum peak heat release rate and test duration, alternative total heat released in the first 10 minutes of the test, mandatory production testing, a longer effective date, taking no action, relying on a voluntary standard, and requiring labeling alone (without any performance requirements).                                                                                                                                               |
| 10.0 minute  | Requiring a criterion of 25 MJ total heat release during the first 10 minutes of the test instead of 15 MJ would likely reduce the estimated benefits (deaths and injuries reduced) without having much effect on costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30.0 minute  | Both options of increasing the duration of the test from 30 minutes to 60 minutes and decreasing the peak rate of heat release from 200 kW to 150 kW would likely increase costs significantly without substantial increase in benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 2018-03-08 | A short section (9.5 mm outer diameter (&#8220;OD&#8221;), about 80 mm long; 3/8 in OD, about 3.2 in long) of copper tubing shall be placed in the inlet gas line just before the burner to facilitate making the burner nominally parallel to the test specimen surface (by a procedure described below).                       |
| 2018-01-08 | Each burner head shall have a separate pilot light consisting of a 3 mm OD (1/8 in OD) copper tube with an independently-controlled supply of propane gas.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-02-03 | Allow the gas to flow for 2-3 minutes until the DTM is stabilized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2018-01-02 | (iii) Move the horizontal burner in/out (loosen the thumb screw near the pivot point) until the outer end of the burner tube is 13 mm to 19 mm (1/2 in to 3/4 in) from the corner bend in the platen (this is facilitated by putting a pair of lines on the top of the platen 13 mm and 19 mm from the bend and parallel to it). |
| 2018-03-04 | (iii) Move the horizontal burner in/out (loosen the thumb screw near the pivot point) until the outer end of the burner tube is 13 mm to 19 mm (1/2 in to 3/4 in) from the corner bend in the platen (this is facilitated by putting a pair of lines on the top of the platen 13 mm and 19 mm from the bend and parallel to it). |
| 2018-01-08 | (iv) Make the horizontal burner parallel to the top of the platen (within 3 mm (1/8 inch) over the burner tube length); when properly parallel, it should not be possible to insert the 3 mm flat stock under either burner end by bending the copper tube section appropriately.                                                |
| 2018-01-04 | The outer end of the burner tube should extend at least 6 mm to 12 mm (1/4 in to 1/2 in) out beyond the uppermost corner/edge of the mattress so that the burner flames will hit the edge.                                                                                                                                       |
