| 7 day      | If the Commission determines, after an investigation, that the requested designated information in a report of harm or manufacturer comment contains materially inaccurate information after the report of harm or manufacturer comment has been published in the Database, the Commission shall, no later than seven business days after such determination: |
|            |               (1) Remove the information determined to be materially inaccurate from the Database, including any associated documents, photographs, or comments;                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 10 day     | Given the requirement of section 6A of the CPSA that reports of harm be published, the Commission will publish reports of harm on the tenth business day after transmitting a report of harm, where the Commission has been unable to make a determination regarding a claim of material inaccuracy prior to the statutorily mandated publication date.       |
| 7 day      | In such instances, the Commission will make any necessary correction, exclusion, or addition not later than seven business days after making a determination that there is materially inaccurate information in the report of harm.                                                                                                                           |
| 10 day     | The Commission will publish reports of harm as soon as practicable, but not later than the tenth business day after such report of harm is transmitted to the manufacturer or private labeler by the CPSC.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10.0 day   | The Commission may publish a report of harm that meets the requirements of &#167;&#8201;1102.10(d) in the Database beyond the 10-business-day time frame set forth in paragraph (a) of this section if the Commission determines that a report of harm misidentifies or fails to identify all manufacturers or private labelers.                              |
