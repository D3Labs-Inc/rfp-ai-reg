| 24.0 month | (b) If a manufacturer has filed a section 37 report within one of the 24-month periods defined in &#167;&#8201;1116.2(a), the manufacturer must also report the information required by section 37(c)(1) for any subsequent settlement or judgment in a civil action that alleges that the same particular model of the product was involved in death or grievous bodily injury and that takes place during the same 24-month period.                                                |
| 30.0 day   | Each such supplemental report must be filed within 30 days of the settlement or final judgment in the reportable civil action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2 year     | Once the statutory criteria of three settled or adjudicated civil actions alleging grievous injury or death in a two year period are met, the obligation to report under section 37 is automatic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2 year     | The provisions in the law limiting such reports to cases in which three or more lawsuits alleging grievous injury or death are settled or adjudicated in favor of plaintiffs during a two year period provide assurance that the product involved presents a sufficiently grave risk of injury to warrant consideration by the Commission.                                                                                                                                           |
| 2 year     | Should a component manufacturer be joined in a civil action against a manufacturer of a consumer product, the section 37 reporting requirements may apply to that manufacturer after a combination of three judgments or settlements involving the same component model during a two year period, even though the manufacturer of the finished product is exempt from such reporting because the lawsuits do not involve the same particular model of the finished consumer product. |
| 2 year     | As long as a particular model of a consumer product is the subject of at least three civil actions that are settled or adjudicated in favor of the plaintiff in one of the statutory two year periods, the manufacturer must report, even though the alleged category of injury and the alleged causal relationship of the product to the injury in each suit may differ.                                                                                                            |
