| 1978-07-11 | (1) In cases involving carpets and rugs distributed in commerce by a domestic manufacturer, or imported into the United States, after July 11, 1978, the Commission will exercise the authority contained in the FFA to order recall of carpets and rugs which fail to comply with the Standard for the Surface Flammability of Carpets and Rugs and which are in the possession of ultimate purchasers, including installed carpet, where the facts, including the number and pattern of test failures, indicate that such action is necessary and appropriate.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1978-07-11 | (2) The Commission may exercise the authority of section 15 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2064) to order the repair, replacement, or repurchase of any carpets or rugs in the possession of ultimate purchasers, including installed carpet, if such carpets and rugs present a &#8220;substantial product hazard&#8221; as that term is used in the Consumer Product Safety Act in any case involving carpets or rugs which were distributed in commerce by a domestic manufacturer or imported into the United States, on or before July 11, 1978, or any time thereafter.                                                                                                                           |
