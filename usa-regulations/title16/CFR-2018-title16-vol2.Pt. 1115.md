| 10.0 day   | The Commission will deem that, at the end of 10 days, a subject firm has received and considered all information which would have been available to it had a reasonable, expeditious, and diligent investigation been undertaken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 24.0 hour  | Immediately, that is, within 24 hours, after a subject firm has obtained information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or voluntary consumer product safety standard, contains a defect which could create a substantial risk of injury to the public, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, the firm should report.                                                                                              |
| 24.0 hour  | If a firm elects to conduct an investigation in order to evaluate the existence of reportable information, the 24-hour period begins when the firm has information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9, contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. |
| 30.0 day   | Manufacturers and private labelers will ordinarily be given 30 days' notice before the Commission makes such affirmative disseminations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
