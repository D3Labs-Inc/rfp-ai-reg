| (253000000.0, 'USD') | The estimated costs caused by these injuries are $253 million, not counting any monetary damages for pain and suffering.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| (35.0, 'USD')        | The Commission estimates that the retail price impact of the standard will be about $35 for the average walk-behind mower.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| (4.4, 'USD')         | Based on an average useful mower-life of about 8 years, the additional annual cost to the purchaser is expected to average about $4.40.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| (4.0, 'USD')         | The cost of these requirements is estimated to be about $4.00 per mower, mostly for redesign of the shields.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| (4.0, 'USD')         | The shield strength requirement is similar to a requirement in the existing voluntary standard that is almost universally complied with, and should comprise only a small portion of the $4.00 retail cost increase compared to pre-standard mowers that is attributable to this related group of requirements. |
| (22000000.0, 'USD')  | (3) The foot probe and related requirements should result in a cost increase of about $22,000,000 and undiscounted injury savings of about $46,000,000, exclusive of any allowance for pain and suffering.                                                                                                      |
| (46000000.0, 'USD')  | (3) The foot probe and related requirements should result in a cost increase of about $22,000,000 and undiscounted injury savings of about $46,000,000, exclusive of any allowance for pain and suffering.                                                                                                      |
| (165000000.0, 'USD') | Together, these requirements are expected to reduce the number of blade contact injuries by 46,500 per year for an undiscounted savings in injury costs of about $165,000,000 per year, exclusive of pain and suffering.                                                                                        |
| (3.0, 'USD')         | (6) Virtually all mowers will be subjected to a cost increase of about $3 for the blade control actuating means and $1 for the second control required to restart the blade.                                                                                                                                    |
| (1.0, 'USD')         | (6) Virtually all mowers will be subjected to a cost increase of about $3 for the blade control actuating means and $1 for the second control required to restart the blade.                                                                                                                                    |
| (1.0, 'USD')         | (The $1 cost could be eliminated for power restart-engine kill mowers that do not start when the blade control is actuated.)                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| (31.0, 'USD')        | (9) The weighted average retail price increase of the blade stop requirements is expected to be about $31 per mower for a total retail cost increase of $167,000,000.                                                                                                                                           |

| 8.0 year    | Based on an average useful mower-life of about 8 years, the additional annual cost to the purchaser is expected to average about $4.40.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3.0 second  | (5) The requirement that the blade stop within 3 seconds of the release of the blade control is supported by (i) the requirement that those mowers that stop the blade by stopping the engine must have a power restart (to remove the motivation to disable the blade control because of the inconven- ience of manually starting the mower each time the control is released) and by (ii) the requirement for an additional control that must be actuated before the blade can resume operation (to prevent accidental starting of the blade). |
| 3.0 second  | (7) Also, most mowers would require a brake for the blade in order to achieve a 3 second stop time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
