| 12.0 year  | The term &#8220;designed or intended primarily&#8221; applies to those consumer products mainly for children 12 years old or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12.0 year  | Whether a product is primarily intended for children 12 years of age or younger is determined by considering the four specified statutory factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12.0 year  | (ii) Whether the product is represented in its packaging, display, promotion, or advertising as appropriate for use by children 12 years of age or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12.0 year  | (iii) Whether the product is commonly recognized by consumers as being intended for use by a child 12 years of age or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12.0 year  | The term &#8220;for use&#8221; by children 12 years or younger generally means that children will physically interact with such products based on the reasonably foreseeable use of such product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12.0 year  | Toys and articles that are subject to the small parts regulations at 16 CFR Part 1501 and in ASTM F963 would fall within the definition of children's product since they are intended for children 12 years of age or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 96.0 month | Toys and other articles intended for children up to 96 months (8 years old) that are subject to the requirements at 16 CFR 1500.48 through 1500.49 and 16 CFR 1500.50 through 1500.53 would similarly fall within the definition of children's product given their age grading for these other regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 12.0 year  | (c) Factors Considered&#8212;To determine whether a consumer product is primarily intended for a child 12 years of age or younger the four specified statutory factors must be considered together as a whole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12.0 year  | A manufacturer's statement that the product is not intended for children does not preclude a product from being regulated as a children's product if the primary appeal of the product is to children 12 years of age or younger, as indicated, for example, by decorations or embellishments that invite use by the child, being sized for a child or being marketed to appeal primarily to children.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 9.0 year   | Such a label may recommend 9 years old as the earliest age for a prospective user, but may or may not indicate the age for which the product is primarily intended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12.0 year  | (2) Whether the product is represented in its packaging, display, promotion, or advertising as appropriate for use by children 12 years of age or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12.0 year  | For example, advertising by the manufacturer expressly declaring that the product is intended for children 12 years of age or younger will support a determination that a product is a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12.0 year  | While, for example advertising by the manufacturer showing children 12 years of age or younger using the product may support a determination that the product is a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|            |             (G) Play value, i.e., features primarily attractive to children 12 years of age or younger that promote interactive exploration and imagination for fanciful purposes (whimsical activities lacking utility for accomplishing mundane tasks; actions performed for entertainment and amusement).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12.0 year  | For example, when a child pretends that a broom is a horse, that does not mean the item is a children's product because the broom's principal use is for sweeping;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 12.0 year  | (2) Collectibles&#8212;Adult collectibles may be distinguished from children's collectibles by themes that are inappropriate for children 12 years of age or younger, have features that preclude use by children during play, such as high cost, limited production, fragile features, display features (such as hooks or pedestals), and are not marketed alongside children's products (for example, in a children's department) in ways that make them indistinguishable from children's products.                                                                                                         |
| 12.0 year  | These characteristics will help jewelry manufacturers and consumers determine whether a particular piece of jewelry is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12.0 year  | In addition, electronic media players and devices that are embellished or decorated with childish themes that are intended to attract children 12 years of age or younger, are sized for children, or are marketed to appeal primarily to children, are not likely to fall under the general use category where children 12 years or younger likely would be the primary users of such devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 12.0 year  | However, electronic devices such as CD players, DVD players, game consoles, book readers, digital media players, cell phones, digital assistant communication devices, and accessories to such devices that are intended mainly for children older than 12 years of age or adults are products for general use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12.0 year  | (5) Art Materials&#8212;Materials sized, decorated, and marketed to children 12 years of age or younger, such as crayons, finger paints, and modeling dough, would be considered children's products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12.0 year  | Crafting kits and supplies that are not specifically marketed to children 12 years of age or younger likely would be considered products intended for general use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12.0 year  | If a distributor or retailer sells or rents a general use product in bulk (such as a raw art materials or art tools) through distribution channels that target children 12 years of age or younger in educational settings, such as schools, summer camps, or child care facilities, this type of a distribution strategy would not necessarily convert a general use product into a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12.0 year  | However, if the product is packaged in such a manner that either expressly states or implies with graphics, themes, labeling, or instructions that the product is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger, then it may be considered a children's product if the required consideration of all four statutory factors supports that determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12.0 year  | An art material designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger would have to be tested by a third party laboratory to demonstrate compliance with CPSIA, but it would not require third party testing and certification to the LHAMA requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12.0 year  | Children's books have themes, vocabularies, illustrations, and covers that match the interests and cognitive capabilities of children 12 years of age or younger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12.0 year  | If a distributor or retailer sells or rents a general use product in bulk through distribution channels that target children 12 years of age or younger in educational settings, such as schools or summer camps, this type of a distribution strategy would not necessarily convert a general use product into a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12.0 year  | However, if the product is packaged in such a manner that either expressly states or implies with graphics, themes, labeling, or instructions that the product is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger, then it may be considered a children's product if the required consideration of all four statutory factors supports that determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12.0 year  | In general, scientific equipment that is specifically sized for children, such as protective gear, eyewear, gloves, or aprons and/or has childish themes or decorations and invites use by a child 12 years of age or younger or is marketed to appeal primarily to children is considered a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 12.0 year  | Sporting equipment, sized for adults, are general use items even though some children 12 years of age or younger will use them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12.0 year  | Unless such items are specifically marketed to children 12 years of age or younger, or have extra features that make them more suitable for children 12 years of age or younger than for adults, they would be considered general use products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 12.0 year  | If children 12 years or younger would mainly use the product because it would be too small or inappropriate for older children to use, then it likely would be considered a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12.0 year  | Likewise, recreational equipment, such as roller blades, skateboards, bicycles, camping gear, and fitness equipment are considered general use products unless they are sized to fit children 12 years of age or younger and/or are decorated with childish features by the manufacturer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12.0 year  | The Commission notes that if a distributor or retailer sells or rents in bulk, a general use musical instrument through distribution channels that target children 12 years of age or younger in educational settings, such as schools or summer camps, this type of a distribution strategy would not necessarily convert a general use product into a children's product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
