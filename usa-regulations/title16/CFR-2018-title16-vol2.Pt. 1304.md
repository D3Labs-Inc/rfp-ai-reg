| (25.0, 'GBP')         | The Commission estimates annual shipments of patching compounds subject to the ban at approximately 30-50 million &#8220;units,&#8221; or individual packages, of various sizes from 0.5 to 25 pounds (dry) or 0.5 to 5 gallons (wet).                                                         |
| (1000000000.0, 'USD') | The Commission estimates that the annual labor cost of drywall finishing in these consumer environments is on the order of $1 billion.                                                                                                                                                         |
| (50.0, 'USD')         | The use of nonasbestos patching compound formulations in all applications may increase this cost by $50-$125 million, assuming that roughly half the current labor costs (i.e., that portion now associated with the use of asbestos formulations) are affected by the 10-25 percent increase. |

| (15000000.0, 'USD')   | The Commission estimates that the wholesale value of manufacturers' and distributors' inventories at the time the ban becomes effective will be approximately $15 million.                                                                                                                     |
| (10.0, 'USD')         | If the increased production costs of asbestos-free formulations can be passed on completely as a result of the ban, the total annual price effect for the year following the issuance of the ban may be $10-$60 million.                                                                       |

| 6 hour     | For purposes of this assessment, the Commission considered the use of patching compounds by the consumer, for six hours a day four times a year, to be a high yet reasonably foreseeable exposure. |
| 5 year     | For five years of exposure at these levels, the risk increases geometrically and is estimated at between 1,000 and 12,000 per million.                                                             |
| 1 year     | The lower estimate of 10 per million is closer to the actual risk for a one-year exposure.                                                                                                         |

| 1978-01-16 | On the basis that airborne asbestos fibers present the hazards of cancer, including lung cancer and mesothelioma to the public, consumer patching compounds containing intentionally-added, respirable free-form asbestos, which have been manufactured or initially introduced into commerce after January 16, 1978, are banned hazardous products. |
| 1978-06-11 | In addition, all other consumer patching compounds containing intentionally-added, respirable free-form asbestos, no matter when manufactured or initially introduced into commerce, are banned hazardous products after June 11, 1978.                                                                                                              |
| 2018-10-25 | The use of nonasbestos patching compound formulations in all applications may increase this cost by $50-$125 million, assuming that roughly half the current labor costs (i.e., that portion now associated with the use of asbestos formulations) are affected by the 10-25 percent increase.                                                       |
| 2018-05-15 | The Commission estimates this cost, which may vary widely from firm to firm, at an average of 5-15 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
