| 1978-06-13 | In addition, any other extremely flammable contact adhesive and similar liquid or semiliquid consumer product, as defined in &#167;&#8201;1302.3(b), no matter when manufactured or initially introduced into commerce, is a banned hazardous product after June 13, 1978.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1976-10-01 | (i) In October 1976, the Commission's staff prepared a report entitled Hazard Analysis on Contact Adhesive Fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1976-01-01 | In January 1976, the President of the ABA sent a letter to the 1,300 ABA members asking the members to record any thermal injuries or deaths that have occurred between January 1975 and March 1976 associated with contact adhesives.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1976-11-01 | In November 1976, the Chairman of the ABA Committee on Burn Prevention submitted a statement to the Commission estimating that between 45 and 125 contact adhesive related injuries are treated annually in hospital emergency rooms.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1975-01-01 | Although ABA members reported an annual rate of 20 severe burn injuries for the January 1975 to March 1976 period, the actual rate of severe burn injuries may be higher, since only approximately 400 hospitals, less than 10 percent of the country's short-term hospitals, are represented in ABA membership.                                                                                                             |

| 2018-10-30 | (i) Technical analysis of these substances by the Commission's staff indicates that extremely flammable contact adhesives have a low flash point (20 &#176;F or below), a rapid evaporation rate (as a result of a high percentage of solvents, 70-90 percent by weight), a low percentage of solids, 10-30 percent by weight, and a low wet-viscosity (300-6,000 centipoise when measured by an RVF Brookfield viscometer). |
| 2018-02-02 | Therefore, consumers probably purchase 2-2.5 million gallon of all contact adhesives, most of which is estimated to be in quart containers, and a smaller amount in containers of one pint or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2001-01-01 | Manufacturers are most likely to switch production to flammable petroleum-based and to 1,1,1,-trichloroethane (1,1,1,-TCE) based or water-based contact adhesives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
