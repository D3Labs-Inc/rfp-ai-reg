| 2018-01-05 | (5) At the end of the second 5-minute test period, take the surrogate multi-purpose lighter from any child who has not successfully operated it.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2018-01-05 | (9) The elapsed time at which the child achieved any operation of the surrogate signal in the second 5-minute test period.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2018-11-18 | (ii) Thus, for the first panel of 100 children, the surrogate passes if there are 0-10 successful operations by the children; the surrogate fails if there are 19 or greater successful operations; and testing is continued if there are 11-18 successes.                                                                            |

| 1999-12-22 | Manufacturers and importers of multi-purpose lighters shall not manufacture or import such lighters that do not comply with the requirements of this part between December 22, 1999 and December 22, 2000, at a rate that is greater than the rate of production or importation during the base period plus 20 per cent of that rate. |
