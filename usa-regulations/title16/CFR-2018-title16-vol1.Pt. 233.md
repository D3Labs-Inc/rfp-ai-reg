| (5.0, 'USD')  | John Doe is a retailer of Brand X fountain pens, which cost him $5 each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (7.5, 'USD')  | His usual markup is 50 percent over cost; that is, his regular retail price is $7.50.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (10.0, 'USD') | In order subsequently to offer an unusual &#8220;bargain&#8221;, Doe begins offering Brand X at $10 per pen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| (9.99, 'USD') | An advertiser who claims that an item has been &#8220;Reduced to $9.99,&#8221; when the former price was $10, is misleading the consumer, who will understand the claim to mean that a much greater, and not merely nominal, reduction was being offered.                                                                              |

| (10.0, 'USD') | Expressed another way, if a number of the principal retail outlets in the area are regularly selling Brand X fountain pens at $10, it is not dishonest for retailer Doe to advertise: &#8220;Brand X Pens, Price Elsewhere $10, Our Price $7.50&#8221;.                                                                                |

| (7.5, 'USD')  | Expressed another way, if a number of the principal retail outlets in the area are regularly selling Brand X fountain pens at $10, it is not dishonest for retailer Doe to advertise: &#8220;Brand X Pens, Price Elsewhere $10, Our Price $7.50&#8221;.                                                                                |
| (15.0, 'USD') | Retailer Doe advertises Brand X pens as having a &#8220;Retail Value $15.00, My Price $7.50,&#8221; when the fact is that only a few small suburban outlets in the area charge $15.                                                                                                                                                    |

| (15.0, 'USD') | Retailer Doe advertises Brand X pens as having a &#8220;Retail Value $15.00, My Price $7.50,&#8221; when the fact is that only a few small suburban outlets in the area charge $15.                                                                                                                                                    |
| (7.5, 'USD')  | All of the larger outlets located in and around the main shopping areas charge $7.50, or slightly more or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| (15.0, 'USD') | The advertisement here would be deceptive, since the price charged by the small suburban outlets would have no real significance to Doe's customers, to whom the advertisement of &#8220;Retail Value $15.00&#8221; would suggest a prevailing, and not merely an isolated and unrepresentative, price in the area in which they shop. |
| (15.0, 'USD') | For example, retailer Doe advertises Brand X pen as having &#8220;Comparable Value $15.00&#8221;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| (10.0, 'USD') | Consider the following example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|               |             (h) Manufacturer Roe, who makes Brand X pens and sells them throughout the United States, advertises his pen in a national magazine as having a &#8220;Suggested Retail Price $10,&#8221; a price determined on the basis of a market survey.                                                                              |
| (10.0, 'USD') | Roe would not be considered to have advertised a fictitious &#8220;suggested retail price.&#8221; If retailer Doe does business in one of these communities, he would not be guilty of a deceptive practice by advertising, &#8220;Brand X Pens, Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, $10, Our Price, $7.50.&#8221;                  |
|               |             (i) It bears repeating that the manufacturer, distributor or retailer must in every case act honestly and in good faith in advertising a list price, and not with the intention of establishing a basis, or creating an instrumentality, for a deceptive comparison in any local or other trade area.                      |
