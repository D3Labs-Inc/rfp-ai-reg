| (4.0, 'USD')       | For the simpler designs of omnidirectional CB base station antennas, the manufacturers' production costs will be increased by approximately 20 percent, or $4 per antenna.                                                                                                                                        |
| (10.0, 'USD')      | The average rise in retail prices due to the standard is expected to be from 20 percent, or about $10 per antenna.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (750000.0, 'USD')  | (2) The Commission estimates that increased retail prices due to the standard will cost consumers up to about $750,000 per year.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (94000.0, 'USD')   | Thus, if the standard saves 8 lives per year, the cost of the standard will be about $94,000 for each life saved.&#8201;1                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| (21000.0, 'USD')   | (3) As to the benefits from reduced injuries, the Commission estimates that, if 8 injuries are prevented during the first year the standard is in effect, the actual costs saved by the accidents prevented by the standard will amount to up to $21,000 to $37,000, exclusive of pain, suffering, or disability. |
| (37000.0, 'USD')   | (3) As to the benefits from reduced injuries, the Commission estimates that, if 8 injuries are prevented during the first year the standard is in effect, the actual costs saved by the accidents prevented by the standard will amount to up to $21,000 to $37,000, exclusive of pain, suffering, or disability. |
| (288000.0, 'USD')  | If a monetary factor for these less quantifiable components is included, annual injury reduction benefits could be about $288,000 to $1,680,000.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (1680000.0, 'USD') | If a monetary factor for these less quantifiable components is included, annual injury reduction benefits could be about $288,000 to $1,680,000.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 5.0 minute | For each contact point, the voltage shall be increased from 0 to 14.5 kV at a rate of at least 2 kV per second and held at 14.5 kV for 5.0 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5.0 minute | The test may be performed with different test positions such that the antenna system flexes after impact and slides off the power line and or so that it remains in contact with the power line for 5.0 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1 year     | The Commission estimated that if the provisions of the standard were issued as a voluntary test method, the total cost of such a voluntary test method to consumers during the first year after issuance would be about 30 percent of the total cost to consumers expected to result from promulgation of a mandatory standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1 year     | The Commission also estimates that the standard will prevent approximately 8 deaths and 8 or more injuries during the first year the standard is in effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1 year     | (3) As to the benefits from reduced injuries, the Commission estimates that, if 8 injuries are prevented during the first year the standard is in effect, the actual costs saved by the accidents prevented by the standard will amount to up to $21,000 to $37,000, exclusive of pain, suffering, or disability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 2018-12-01 | The Commission declined to issue the provisions of the standard as a voluntary test method because it concluded that such an approach would not only prevent fewer deaths and injuries each year than a mandatory standard, but would also have a less favorable ratio of benefits to costs than a mandatory standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
