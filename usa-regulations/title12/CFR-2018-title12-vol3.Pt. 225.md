| 1987-03-05 | (i) The cross-marketing restriction in section 4(f)(3) contains a grandfather provision that permits products or services that would otherwise be prohibited from being offered or marketed under the provision to continue to be offered or marketed by a particular entity if the products or services were being so offered or marketed as of March 5, 1987, but &#8220;only in the same manner in which they were being offered or marketed as of that date.&#8221; Thus, to qualify for the grandfather provision, the manner of offering or marketing the otherwise prohibited product or service must remain the same as on the grandfather date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
