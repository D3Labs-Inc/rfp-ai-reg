| 2018-12-01 | In reviewing whether a declaration by a subsidiary of the mutual holding company is appropriate, the Board may consider, among other factors, the reasonableness of the entire dividend distribution declared if the waiver is not approved;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |               (vii) The waived dividends are excluded from the capital accounts of the subsidiary holding company or savings association, as applicable, for purposes of calculating any future dividend payments;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (viii) The mutual holding company appropriately accounts for all waived dividends in a manner that permits the Board to consider the waived dividends in evaluating the proposed exchange ratio in the event of a full conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
