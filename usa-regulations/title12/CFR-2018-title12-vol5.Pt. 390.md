# Summary

(iv) Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Any transaction (which for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv) means a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, extension of credit, purchase or sale of any stock, bond, certificate of deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through, or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected) conducted or attempted by, at or through the State savings association involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the State savings association knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that:
In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is ongoing, the State savings association shall immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement authority and the FDIC in addition to filing a timely SAR.
In that case, the State savings association must separately risk-weight the on-balance sheet servicing asset and the related recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes under this section, and incorporate these amounts into the risk-based capital calculation.

| 1989-11-07 | (C) Once a State savings association selects either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section for the issuance of a maturing capital instrument, it must continue to elect that option for all subsequent issuances of maturing capital instruments for as long as there is a balance outstanding of such post-November 7, 1989, issuances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1989-04-12 | (3) If a State savings association has any investments (both debt and equity) in one or more subsidiary(ies) engaged as of April 12, 1989, and continuing to be engaged in any activity that would not fall within the scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries may engage, it must deduct such investments from assets and, thus, tangible capital in accordance with this paragraph (c)(3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1989-04-12 | The State savings association must first deduct from assets and, thus, capital the amount by which any investments in such a subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of such investments held by the State savings association as of April 12, 1989.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
