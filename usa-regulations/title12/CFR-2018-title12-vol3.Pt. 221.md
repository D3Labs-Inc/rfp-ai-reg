| 24.0 month | (b) According to the current offering under the Plan, an employee of the AT&amp;T system may purchase shares through regular deductions from his pay over a period of 24 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2 year     | Since the program extends over two years, it follows that the payroll deductions for this purpose may be in the neighborhood of 38 percent of base pay and a larger percentage of &#8220;take-home pay.&#8221; Deductions of this magnitude are in excess of the saving rate of many employees.                                                                                                                                           |
| 24.0 month | A bank proposed to receive such stock as collateral for a &#8220;living expenses&#8221; loan that will be advanced to the employee in monthly installments over the 24-month period, each installment being in the amount of the employee's monthly payroll deduction under the Plan.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 24.0 month | The aggregate amount of the advances over the 24-month period would be substantially greater than the maximum loan value of the collateral as prescribed in &#167;&#8201;221.7 (the Supplement).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 24.0 month | At the end of the 24-month period the borrower would acquire a certain number of shares of that stock and would be indebted to the lending bank in an amount approximately equal to the amount he would pay for such shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 6.0 month  | (c) The purpose statement will be supplemented with several additional questions relevant to the prospective borrower's investment activities such as purchases of any security within the last 6 months, dollar amount, and obligations to purchase or pay for previous purchases; present plans to purchase securities in the near future, participations in securities purchase plans, list of unpaid debts, and present income level. |
| 1.0 year   | (d) Also considered was an alternative proposal under which X would deposit proceeds from accounts receivable in a time account for 1 year, before using those funds to purchase mutual fund shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15.0 year  | A typical plan may run for 10 or 15 years with annual insurance premiums due.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|            |             (iv) The collateral for the credit is not changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1997-01-01 | (1) A transfer of a credit between customers or between lenders shall not be considered a new extension of credit if:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            |             (i) The original credit was extended by a lender in compliance with this part or by a lender subject to part 207 of this chapter in effect prior to April 1, 1998, (See part 207 appearing in the 12 CFR parts 200 to 219 edition revised as of January 1, 1997), in a manner that would have complied with this part;                                                                                                                                            |
|            |             (ii) The transfer is not made to evade this part;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            |             (iii) The amount of credit is not increased; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            |             (iv) The collateral for the credit is not changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2018-03-01 | Section 221.3(c) provides in that whenever a lender is required to have its customer execute a &#8220;Statement of Purpose for an Extension of Credit Secured by Margin Stock,&#8221; the statement must be accepted by the lender &#8220;acting in good faith.&#8221; The requirement of &#8220;good faith&#8221; is of vital importance here.                                                                                                                               |
| 2018-03-01 | Questions have arisen as to the adequacy of statements received by lending banks under &#167;&#8201;221.3(c), &#8220;Purpose Statement,&#8221; in the case of loans to brokers or dealers secured by margin stock where the proceeds of the loans are to be used to finance customer transactions involving the purchasing or carrying of margin stock.                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-03-01 | (g) Similarly, the fact that a loan made on the borrower's signature only, for example, becomes secured by margin stock shortly after the disbursement of the loan usually would afford reasonable grounds for questioning the bank's apparent reliance upon merely a statement that the purpose of the loan was not to purchase or carry margin stock.                                                                                                                       |
| 2018-03-01 | (a) This part governs &#8220;any purpose credit&#8221; extended by a lender &#8220;secured directly or indirectly by margin stock&#8221; and defines &#8220;purpose credit&#8221; as &#8220;any credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental, or ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock, &#8220; with certain exceptions, and provides that the maximum loan value of such margin stock shall be a fixed percentage &#8220;of its current market value.&#8221; |
|            |               (b) The Board of Governors has had occasion to consider the application of the language in paragraph (a) of this section to the two following questions:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (1) Loan secured by stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2018-03-01 | If, for example, the original agreement between borrower and lender contemplated that the loan should be secured by margin stock, and such stock is in fact delivered to the bank when available, the transaction must be regarded as fundamentally a secured loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2018-03-01 | This view is strengthened by the fact that this part applies to a loan &#8220;secured directly or indirectly by margin stock.&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |               (2) Loan to acquire controlling shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2018-03-01 | (ii) The answer is required, in the Board's view, since the language of this part is explicitly inclusive, covering &#8220;any purpose credit, secured directly or indirectly by margin stock.&#8221; Moreover, the withdrawal in 1945 of the original section 2(e) of this part, which exempted &#8220;any loan for the purpose of purchasing a stock from or through a person who is not a member of a national securities exchange .                                       |
| 2018-03-01 | (a) A question has been presented to the Board as to whether a loan by a bank to a mutual investment fund is &#8220;secured * * * indirectly by margin stock&#8221; within the meaning of &#167;&#8201;221.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2018-03-01 | However, a loan by a bank is not subject to this part unless: it is a purpose credit; and it is &#8220;secured directly or indirectly by margin stock&#8221;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2018-03-01 | The conclusion that any given arrangement makes a credit &#8220;indirectly secured&#8221; by margin stock may, but need not, be reinforced by facts such as that the stock in question was purchased with proceeds of the loan, that the lender suggests or insists upon the arrangement, or that the loan would probably be subject to criticism by supervisory authorities were it not for the protective arrangement.                                                      |

| 2018-03-01 | Since the debt securities contain no direct security agreement involving the margin stock, applicability of the lending restrictions of this part turns on whether the arrangement constitutes an extension of credit that is secured indirectly by margin stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2018-03-01 | However, credit is not &#8220;indirectly secured&#8221; by margin stock if the lender in good faith has not relied on the margin stock as collateral extending or maintaining credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2018-03-01 | The presumption that the debt securities are indirectly secured by margin stock would not apply if there is specific evidence that lenders could in good faith rely on assets other than margin stock as collateral, such as a guaranty of the debt securities by the shell corporation's parent company or another company that has substantial non-margin stock assets or cash flow.                                                                                        |

| 2018-03-01 | (g) In addition, the Board is of the view that the debt securities described in paragraph (b) of this section are indirectly secured by margin stock because there is a practical restriction on the ability of the shell corporation to dispose of the margin stock of the target company.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
