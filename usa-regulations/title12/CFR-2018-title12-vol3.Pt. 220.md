| 90.0 day   | (c) The Board expressed the view that the account becomes subject to the 90-day disqualification in &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(8).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 90.0 day   | Hence payment can not be said to have been made prior to such delivery; the purchased security has been delivered out to a broker without previously having been paid for in full, and the account becomes subject to the 90-day disqualification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7 day      | Although the securities are available for prompt delivery by the broker-dealer firm selected to effect the system's purchase, it is arranged in advance with the firm that the system will not accept delivery and pay for the securities before some date more than seven business days after the date on which the securities are purchased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7 day      | One such requirement is that the purchase be made &#8220;in reliance upon an agreement accepted by the creditor (broker-dealer) in good faith&#8221; that the customer will &#8220;promptly make full cash payment for the security, if funds sufficient for the purpose are not already in the account; and, subject to certain exceptions, &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(2) provides that the creditor shall promptly cancel or liquidate the transaction if payment is not made by the customer within seven business days after the date of purchase.                                                 |
| 7 day      | (e) Section 220.4(c)(5) provides that if the creditor, &#8220;acting in good faith in accordance with&#8221; &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(1), purchases a security for a customer &#8220;with the understanding that he is to deliver the security promptly to the customer, and the full cash payment is to be made promptly by the customer is to be made against such delivery&#8221;, the creditor may at his option treat the transaction as one to which the period applicable under &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(2) is not the seven days therein specified but 35 days after the date of such purchase. |
| 35.0 day   | (e) Section 220.4(c)(5) provides that if the creditor, &#8220;acting in good faith in accordance with&#8221; &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(1), purchases a security for a customer &#8220;with the understanding that he is to deliver the security promptly to the customer, and the full cash payment is to be made promptly by the customer is to be made against such delivery&#8221;, the creditor may at his option treat the transaction as one to which the period applicable under &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(2) is not the seven days therein specified but 35 days after the date of such purchase. |
| 90.0 day   | Exception to 90-day rule in special cash account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 90.0 day   | (c) Section 220.4(c)(8) prohibits a creditor, as a general rule, from effecting a purchase of a security in a customer's special cash account if any security has been purchased in that account during the preceding 90 days and has then been sold in the account or delivered out to any broker or dealer without having been previously paid for in full by the customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 90.0 day   | Therefore, in the rare case where the operation of the subject exception to &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(8) is necessary to avoid application of the 90-day rule, a creditor should ascertain (from his bank of deposit or otherwise) the fact of payment of a customer's check given for the purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 7.0 day    | (a) The Board has recently considered the question whether, in connection with the purchase of mutual fund shares in a &#8220;special cash account&#8221; under the provisions of this part 220, the 7-day period with respect to liquidation for nonpayment is that described in &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(2) or that described in &#167;&#8201;220.4(c)(3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7.0 day    | The specific inquiry to the Board was, in effect, whether the 7-day period after which a purchase transaction must be liquidated or cancelled for nonpayment should run, in the case of mutual fund shares, from the time when a certificate for the purchased shares is available for delivery to the purchaser, instead of from the date of the purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7.0 day    | (d) Under the general rule of &#167;&#8201;220.4 (c)(2) that is applicable to purchases of outstanding securities, the 7-day period runs from the date of purchase without regard to the time required for the mechanical acts of transfer of ownership and delivery of a certificate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
