| 60.0 day   | Consistent with &#167;&#8201;4.33(a)(2), the OCC weighs a request to respond to provide information in less than 60 days against the unfairness to other requesters whose pending requests may be delayed and the burden imposed on the OCC by the expedited processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
