# ID

 CFR-2018-title12-vol5.Pt. 308


# Summary

The failure of a foreign bank to comply with any order of removal or prohibition issued by the Board of Directors or the failure of any person associated with a foreign bank to appear promptly as a party to a proceeding pursuant to section 8(e) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)), shall be a ground for termination of insurance of deposits in any branch of the bank.
If the Board of Directors finds that a savings association is a special supervisory association under the provisions of section 8(a)(8)(B) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(a)(8)(B)) for purposes of temporary suspension of insured status, the Board of Directors shall serve upon the association its findings with regard to the determination that the capital of the association, as computed using applicable accounting standards, has suffered a material decline; that such association or its directors or officers, is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the association; that such association is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operating as an insured association; or that such association or its directors or officers, has violated any law, rule, regulation, order, condition imposed in writing by any Federal banking agency, or any written agreement, or that the association failed to enter into a capital improvement plan acceptable to the Corporation prior to January, 1990.
Pursuant to section 8(i)(2)(A) of the FDI Act, the FDIC may assess a civil money penalty against any bank or state savings association that violates or otherwise fails to comply with any final order issued under section 39 and against any institution-affiliated party who participates in such violation or noncompliance.
