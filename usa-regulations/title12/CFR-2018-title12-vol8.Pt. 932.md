|            |             (B) For derivative contracts that automatically reset to zero value following a payment, the residual maturity equals the time until the next payment; however, interest rate contracts with remaining maturities of greater than one year shall be subject to a minimum conversion factor of 0.5 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
