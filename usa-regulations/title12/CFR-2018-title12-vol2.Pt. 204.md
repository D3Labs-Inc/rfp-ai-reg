L. 96-221) in effect on September 1, 1980.                                                                                                        |

| 1980-08-27 | (2) On August 27, 1980, the Board announced the procedures that will apply to such pass-through arrangements (45 FR 58099).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1981-08-31 | In order to avoid unduly disrupting account relationships, a NOW account established at a member bank on or before August 31, 1981, that represents funds of a nonqualifying entity that previously qualified to maintain a NOW account may continue to be maintained in a NOW account.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2018-08-01 | In 1982, the Board issued an interpretation concerning the effect of a member bank's purchase of its own time deposits in the secondary market in order to ensure compliance with regulatory restrictions on the payment of interest on time deposits, with the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits, and with regulatory requirements designed to distinguish between time deposits and demand deposits for federal reserve requirement purposes (47 FR 37878, Aug.       |
| 1986-04-01 | (b) Because the expiration of the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act (title II of Pub. L. 96-221) on April 1, 1986, removed the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits, one of the purposes for adopting the interpretation was eliminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 9629-03-01 | Effective April 1, 1986, the Board amended its Regulation D to incorporate early withdrawal penalties applicable to all depository institutions for this purpose (51 FR 9629, Mar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1988-03-31 | (a) Effective March 31, 1988, the glossary section of the instructions for the Report of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031-034; OMB control number 7100-0036; available from a depository institution's primary federal regulator) (Call Report) was amended to clarify that certain short-term loan participation arrangements (sometimes known or styled as loan strips or strip participations) are regarded as borrowings rather than sales for Call Report purposes in certain circumstances. |
