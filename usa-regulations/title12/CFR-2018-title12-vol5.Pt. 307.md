The notice to depositors required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided on the official letterhead of the insured depository institution, shall bear the signature of a duly authorized officer, and, unless otherwise specified by the appropriate Regional Director, may follow the form of the notice contained in Appendix B of this part.
