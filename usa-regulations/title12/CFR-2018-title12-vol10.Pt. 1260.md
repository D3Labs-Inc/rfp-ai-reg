FHFA may distribute information as provided in the notice issued under &#167;&#8201;1260.2(b) after the expiration of the applicable time period specified in &#167;&#8201;1260.3(b) unless, within that time period, the affected Bank has filed with FHFA a written request to withhold particular proprietary information that meets the requirements of &#167;&#8201;1260.3(a).
