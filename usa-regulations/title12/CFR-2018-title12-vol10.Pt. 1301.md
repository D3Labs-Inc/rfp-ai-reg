|            |           (iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, then a failure to comply with such time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30.0 day   | If the Council does not receive this written direction and agreement/specification within thirty (30) days of the date of the denial notification letter, then the Council shall deem the FOIA request to be withdrawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 30.0 day   | (4) If a requester previously has failed to pay a fee within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the billing, the requester shall be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Council begins to process a new request or the pending request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30.0 day   | The Council may presume that multiple requests involving related matters submitted within a thirty (30) calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
