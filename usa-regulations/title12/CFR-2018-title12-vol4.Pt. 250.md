| 12.0 month | It was proposed that they be issued in denominations of $50 to $100 and initially be of 12-month or less maturities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 9 month    | For purposes of this interpretation, commercial paper may be defined as notes, with maturities not exceeding nine months, the proceeds of which are to be used for current transactions, which are usually sold to sophisticated institutional investors, rather than to members of the general public, in minimum denominations of $10,000 (although sometimes they may be sold in minimum denominations of $5,000). |
| 60.0 day   | In one instance, it appeared that the stock would be issued over a period of from 30 to 60 days; in the other instance it was stated that the stock would be sold by a firm of underwriters and that distribution was expected to be completed in not more than a few days.                                                                                                                                           |
| 5 year     | (d) While the greater part of the total annual income of Manager during the past five years has derived from &#8220;individuals, institutions, and other clients&#8221;, it appears that a substantial portion has been attributable to the involvement with the two funds in question.                                                                                                                               |

| 12 month   | The Information presented stated that the total dollar volume of section 32 business of Corporation during the first eleven months of its operation was $89 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3.0 year   | Gross volume has risen from $4 to $10 million over the past 3 years, but underwriting has accounted for no more than one-half of 1 percent of that amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
