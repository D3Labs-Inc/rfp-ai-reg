# ID

 CFR-2018-title12-vol3.Pt. 223


# Summary

The valuation principles of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to a member bank's purchase of or investment in a debt security issued by an affiliate, which is governed by &#167;&#8201;223.23.
A purchase from an affiliate of a line of credit, revolving credit facility, or other similar credit arrangement for a nonaffiliate must be valued initially at the total amount of consideration given by the member bank in exchange for the asset plus any additional amount that the member bank could be required to provide to the borrower under the terms of the credit arrangement.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of &#167;&#8201;223.32 with respect to financial subsidiaries, a member bank's purchase of or investment in a security issued by an affiliate must be valued at the greater of:
Eligible affiliated mutual fund securities are not considered to be securities issued by an affiliate, and are instead considered to be nonaffiliate collateral, for purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, unless the member bank knows or has reason to know that the proceeds of the extension of credit will be used to purchase the eligible affiliated mutual fund securities collateral or will otherwise be used for the benefit of or transferred to an affiliate of the member bank.

|            |               (B) Each renewal or extension of additional credit described in this paragraph (b) meets the standards; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            |               (C) The board of directors of the member bank periodically reviews renewals and extensions of additional credit described in this paragraph (b) to ensure that they meet the standards and periodically reviews the standards to ensure that they continue to meet the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |               (3) The participating member bank's share of the renewal or extension of additional credit does not exceed its proportional share of the original transaction by more than 5 percent, unless the member bank obtains the prior written approval of its appropriate Federal banking agency; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            |               (4) The participating member bank provides its appropriate Federal banking agency with written notice of the renewal or extension of additional credit not later than 20 days after consummation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12.0 month | To determine whether a credit card qualifies as a general purpose credit card under the standard set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, a member bank must compute compliance on a monthly basis, based on cardholder purchases that were financed by the credit card during the preceding 12 calendar months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12.0 month | The member bank assesses its compliance under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section on the 15th day of every month (for the preceding 12 calendar months).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12.0 month | On June 15, 2005, however, the member bank determines that, for the 12-calendar-month period from June 1, 2004, through May 31, 2005, 27 percent of the total value of products and services purchased with the card by all cardholders were purchases of products and services from an affiliate of the member bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12.0 month | Unless the credit card returns to compliance with the 25 percent limit by the 12-calendar-month period ending August 31, 2005, the card will cease to qualify as a general purpose credit card as of September 1, 2005.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1 year     | If the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate less than one year after the member bank enters into the credit transaction with the nonaffiliate, the member bank also must ensure that the credit transaction complies with the collateral requirements of &#167;&#8201;223.14 promptly after the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 9 month    | Nine months later, the member bank's holding company purchases all the stock of the nonaffiliate, thereby making the nonaffiliate an affiliate of the member bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1 day      | A transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section is exempt from the requirements of this regulation (other than the safety and soundness requirement of &#167;&#8201;223.13 and the market terms requirement of &#167;&#8201;223.51) if:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
