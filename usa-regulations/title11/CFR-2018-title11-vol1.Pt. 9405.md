| 2 hour     | When the cost of such search (including operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of salary of the person performing the search (i.e., the operator), the Commission will begin assessing charges for computer search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2 hour     | Commercial use requesters are neither entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3 hour     | The Commission shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30.0 day   | The fact that the fee has been received by the Commission within the 30-day grace period, even if it is not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
