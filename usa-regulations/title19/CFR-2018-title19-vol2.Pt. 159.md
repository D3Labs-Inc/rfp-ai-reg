| (1.0, 'USD')  | Except in the case of alcoholic beverages treated under &#167;&#8201;159.4, if a rate of duty is specific and $1 or less per unit, fractional quantities, if less than one-half, shall be disregarded, and if one-half or more shall be treated as a whole unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
