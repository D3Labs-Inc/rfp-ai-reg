| 40.0 year  | (i) For authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized officer finds that the ski area development meets the following standards:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |             (A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 years;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|            |             (C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation and maintenance costs;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |             (D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, located predominately on land authorized under a permit;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            |             (E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or operation;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 40.0 year  | (ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized officer's discretion:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
