| 4.0 year   | Where a plan's monitoring program has been developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation and the unit has not initiated plan revision under this part, the responsible official shall modify the plan monitoring program within 4 years of the effective date of this part, or as soon as practicable, to meet the requirements of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2.0 year   | (i) The first monitoring evaluation for a plan or plan revision developed in accordance with this subpart must be completed no later than 2 years from the effective date of plan decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2.0 year   | (ii) Where the monitoring program developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation has been modified to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the first monitoring evaluation must be completed no later than 2 years from the date the change takes effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1.0 year   | (iii) The monitoring evaluation report may be postponed for 1 year in case of exigencies, but notice of the postponement must be provided to the public prior to the date the report is due for that year (&#167;&#8201;219.16(c)(6)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 90.0 day   | Except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity, a proposed amendment that may create a significant environmental effect and thus requires preparation of an environmental impact statement is considered a significant change in the plan for the purposes of the NFMA and therefore requires a 90-day comment period for the proposed plan and draft environmental impact statement (&#167;&#8201;219.16(a)(2)), in addition to meeting the requirements of this section.                                                                                 |
