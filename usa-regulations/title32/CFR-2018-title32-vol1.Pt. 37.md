| (5000.0, 'USD')   | You may accept the full value of a donated capital asset if the real property or equipment is to be dedicated to the project and you expect that it will have a fair market value that is less than $5,000 at the project's end.                                                                                                                           |
| (800000.0, 'USD') | (b) To illustrate the approach, consider a project for which you are confident that the recipient will have to expend at least $800,000 to achieve the specified outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| (480000.0, 'USD') | In that case, the Federal share should be no more than 60% and you could set a fixed level of Federal support at $480,000 (60% of $800,000).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| (500000.0, 'USD') | (1) Should require that the participant have an independent auditor (i.e., the DCAA or an independent public accountant) conduct periodic audits of its systems if it expends $500,000 or more per year in TIAs and other Federal assistance awards.                                                                                                       |
| (5000.0, 'USD')   | (1) Judge that the real property or equipment will be dedicated to the project and have a current fair market value that is less than $5,000 by the time the project ends; or                                                                                                                                                                              |
| (5000.0, 'USD')   | Your TIA, whether it is a fixed-support or expenditure-based award, must specify that any item of equipment that has a fair market value of $5,000 or more at the conclusion of the project also will be subject to the disposition process in 32 CFR 34.21(e), whereby the Federal Government will recover its interest in the property at that time.     |
| (120000.0, 'USD') | If your expenditure-based TIA provides for either advance payments or payable milestones, the agreement must require the recipient to:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 5 year     | Your solicitation should tell potential proposers that:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            |                 (a) For all TIAs, information described in paragraph (b) of this section is exempt from disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)(codified at 5 U.S.C. 552) for a period of five years after the date on which the DoD Component receives the information from them.                                                                   |
| 5 year     | (c) If proposers desire to protect business plans and technical information for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements, they must mark them with a legend identifying them as documents submitted on a confidential basis.                                                                                                                                              |

| 3 year     | The frequency thereafter may vary depending upon the dollars the participant is expending annually under the award, but it is not unreasonable to require an updated audit every two to three years to reverify that the participant's systems are reliable (the audit then would cover the two or three-year period between audits).                                         |
| 3 year     | The frequency thereafter may vary depending upon the dollars the participant is expending annually under the award, but it is not unreasonable to require an updated audit every two to three years to reverify that the participant's systems are reliable (the audit then would cover the two or three-year period between audits).                                         |
| 3 year     | You must specify that the IPA is to retain working papers for a period of at least three years after the final payment, unless the working papers relate to an audit whose findings are not fully resolved within that period or to an unresolved claim or dispute (in which case, the IPA must keep the working papers until the matter is resolved and final action taken). |
| 5 year     | (b) If the participant also provides information in the course of a competition prior to award, there is a statutory exemption for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements for certain types of information submitted at that time (see &#167;&#8201;37.420).                                                                                                            |
| 3 year     | Your TIA must require participants to keep records related to the TIA (for which the agreement provides Government access under &#167;&#8201;37.915) for a period of three years after submission of the final financial status report for an expenditure-based TIA or final programmatic status report for a fixed-support TIA, with the following exceptions:               |
|            |                   (a) The participant must keep records longer than three years after submission of the final financial status report if the records relate to an audit, claim, or dispute that begins but does not reach its conclusion within the 3-year period.                                                                                                            |

|            |                   (a) The participant must keep records longer than three years after submission of the final financial status report if the records relate to an audit, claim, or dispute that begins but does not reach its conclusion within the 3-year period.                                                                                                            |

| 3 year     | (b) Records for any real property or equipment acquired with project funds under the TIA must be kept for three years after final disposition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 2018-03-01 | Should my patent provision include march-in rights?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2018-03-01 | Your TIA's patent rights provision should include the Bayh-Dole march-in rights clause at paragraph (j)(1) of 37 CFR 401.14, or an equivalent clause, concerning actions that the Government may take to obtain the right to use subject inventions, if the recipient fails to take effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject inventions within a reasonable time. |
| 2018-03-01 | The march-in provision may be modified to best meet the needs of the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2018-03-01 | However, only infrequently should the march-in provision be entirely removed (e.g., you may wish to do so if a recipient is providing most of the funding for a research project, with the Government providing a much smaller share).                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2018-12-01 | (b) If they wish to designate one consortium member to sign the agreement on behalf of the consortium as a whole, you should not decide whether to execute the agreement in that way until you review the consortium's articles of collaboration with legal counsel.                                                                                                                     |
