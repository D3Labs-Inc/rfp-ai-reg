| 1975-01-01 | Do not deny anyone a legal right, benefit, or privilege for refusing to give their Social Security Number unless the law requires disclosure, or a law or regulation adopted before January 1, 1975 required the Social Security Number and the Air Force uses it to verify a person's identity in a system of records established before that date.                                                                                                         |
| 1975-01-01 | When law does not require disclosing the Social Security Number or when the system of records was created after January 1, 1975, you may ask for the Social Security Number, but the individual does not have to disclose it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
