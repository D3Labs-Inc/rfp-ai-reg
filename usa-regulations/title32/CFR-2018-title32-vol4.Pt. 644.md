|            |                   (a) In leases pertaining to provisions for termination by the Government prior to the end of the term, and which require 60 days written notice of demand for restoration, a supplemental agreement relinquishing space prior to the end of the term, which contains a stipulation excepting restoration from the provisions of the release may be regarded as notice to the Government of the lessor's intention to require restoration and an otherwise proper claim for restoration may be considered where the entire transaction is in the interest of the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30.0 day   | (b) In leases which require 30 days written notice of termination and 30 days notice of demand for restoration, waiver of termination notice by the lessor would constitute sufficient consideration to support a waiver of restoration notice by the Government where the effect of waiving the notices would be to protect more adequately the Government's interest through immediate termination of the lease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30.0 day   | (b) In leases which require 30 days written notice of termination and 30 days notice of demand for restoration, waiver of termination notice by the lessor would constitute sufficient consideration to support a waiver of restoration notice by the Government where the effect of waiving the notices would be to protect more adequately the Government's interest through immediate termination of the lease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 90.0 day   | (c) Generally, in leases which require 90 days written notice of demand for restoration and 30 days written notice of termination, if it is determined administratively under the particular facts, that the failure to give restoration notice until receipt of termination notice does not affect the merits of the claim for restoration, or operate to the prejudice of the United States, an otherwise proper claim for restoration may be considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30.0 day   | (c) Generally, in leases which require 90 days written notice of demand for restoration and 30 days written notice of termination, if it is determined administratively under the particular facts, that the failure to give restoration notice until receipt of termination notice does not affect the merits of the claim for restoration, or operate to the prejudice of the United States, an otherwise proper claim for restoration may be considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30.0 day   | (d) As a general rule, in leases which require 30 days written notice of termination and 30 days written notice of demand for restoration, notice of demand for restoration given within a reasonable time after receipt of termination notice would be sufficient and, in this connection, a few days delay would not be regarded as unreasonable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
