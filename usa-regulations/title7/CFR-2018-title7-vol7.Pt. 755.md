| (8000.0, 'USD') | Payment amount means the amount due a producer that is the sum of all eligible reimbursement amounts, as calculated by FSA subject to the availability of funds, and subject to an $8,000 cap per producer per FY.                                                                                                                  |

| (8000.0, 'USD') | For example, a partnership of four individuals would be considered one producer, not four persons, for the purposes of this cap and thus the partnership could only generate a single $8,000 payment under this program if the cap holds because of full subscription of the program.                                               |
| (8000.0, 'USD') | (e) Payment amounts are subject to $8,000 cap per FY per producer as defined in this part, not per &#8220;person&#8221; or &#8220;legal entity&#8221; as those terms might be defined in part 1400 of this title.                                                                                                                   |
