| 1996-02-13 | (a) Each PUC is eligible until February 13, 1996 to develop a proposed Modernization Plan and deliver it to RUS.                                                                                                                 |
| 1996-02-13 | In particular, beginning February 13, 1996, RUS will make RUS hardship loans, RUS cost-of-money loans, and RTB loans for facilities and other RE Act purposes in a State only if:                                                |
|            |               (1) The State has an RUS approved Modernization Plan; and                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |               (2) The Borrower to whom the loan is to be made is participating in the Modernization Plan for the State.                                                                                                          |
| 1996-02-13 | Because RUS does not have authority to extend the term of a PUC's eligibility, RUS recommends that the PUC submit a proposed Modernization Plan at least 90 days in advance of February 13, 1996 to allow time for this process. |
| 1995-03-15 | These revisions shall not invalidate Modernization Plans approved by RUS but shall be used by RUS to determine whether to approve amendments to Modernization Plans presented for RUS approval after March 15, 1995.             |
