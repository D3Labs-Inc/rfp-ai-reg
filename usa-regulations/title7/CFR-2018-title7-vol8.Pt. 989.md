| 2018-10-05 | On or before October 5 of each crop year (except that the Committee may extend this date not more than five business days if warranted by a late crop), the Committee shall estimate the production of any varietal type of raisins for which it has computed a trade demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2018-02-15 | Prior to February 15, the Committee may modify the preliminary free and reserve percentages to release less than the trade demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2018-02-15 | No later than February 15, the Committee shall recommend to the Secretary, final free and reserve percentages which will tend to release the full trade demand for any varietal type for which preliminary or interim percentages have been computed and announced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2018-11-15 | On or before November 15 of the crop year, the Committee shall make two simultaneous offers of reserve tonnage to handlers to sell as free tonnage for each varietal type for which preliminary percentages have been computed and announced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2018-11-30 | On or before November 30 of each crop year, the committee shall hold a meeting to review production data, supply data, demand data, including anticipated demand to all potential market outlets, desirable carryout inventory, and other matters relating to the quantity of raisins of all varietal types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2018-06-01 | Any handler may request the committee, by registered or certified mail, at any time after June 1 of a crop year to remove or relocate reserve tonnage raisins of the current crop year which remain in his possession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2018-09-15 | When so requested as to current crop year raisins, the committee shall make the removal or relocation, the availability of containers, storage space and time of request permitting, by September 15 of the subsequent crop year, and as to raisins of the prior crop year, within 30 days, supplying the necessary containers if so requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2018-09-15 | If the committee removes or relocates reserve raisins of the current crop year pursuant to a handler's request, and such raisins are released to him by September 15 of the subsequent crop year, the handler shall reimburse the committee for any costs incurred by it in such removal or relocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
