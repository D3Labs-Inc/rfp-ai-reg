| 2018-03-01 | FAS will use the following criteria in evaluating proposals:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |               (1) The nature of the specific export barrier and the extent to which the proposal is likely to successfully remove, resolve, or mitigate that barrier;                                                                                                                                                       |
|            |               (2) The potential trade impact of the proposed project on market retention, market access, and market expansion, including the potential for expanding commercial sales in the targeted market;                                                                                                               |
|            |               (3) The completeness and viability of the proposal;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            |               (4) The ability of the organization to provide an experienced staff with the requisite technical and trade experience to execute the proposal;                                                                                                                                                                |
|            |               (5) The extent to which the proposal is targeted to a market in which the United States is generally competitive;                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |               (6) The cost of the project and the amount of other resources dedicated to the project, including cash and goods and services of the U.S. industry and foreign third parties;                                                                                                                                 |
|            |               (7) The degree to which time is essential to addressing specific export barriers;                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            |               (8) In cases where the CCC receives multiple proposals from different applicants which address essentially the same barrier, the nature of the applicant organization will be taken into consideration, with a greater weight given to those organizations with the broadest base of producer representation. |
