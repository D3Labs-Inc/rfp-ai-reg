| 2018-01-31 | The Secretary may, on recommendation of the Committee submitted prior to January 31 of the crop year, or on the basis of other information available to him, increase the free percentage to conform with such new relation as may be found to exist between trade demand for free dates and available supply of marketable dates of applicable grade and size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
