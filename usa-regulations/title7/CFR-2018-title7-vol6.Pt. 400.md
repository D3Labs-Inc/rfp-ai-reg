| 2.0 second | (g) In considering whether to approve policies or plans of insurance and when such policies or plans of insurance will be offered for sale, the Board will:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            |               (1) First, consider policies or plans of insurance that address underserved commodities, including commodities for which there is no insurance;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (2) Second, consider existing policies or plans of insurance for which there is inadequate coverage or there exists low levels of participation; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            |               (3) Last, consider all policies or plans of insurance submitted to the Board that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 90.0 day   | (j) The Board will render a decision on a 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance, with or without revision or give notice of intent to disapprove within 90 days after the date the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance is considered complete by the Board, unless the Board agrees to a time delay in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 90.0 day   | (iii) Coverage would be similar to another policy or plan of insurance that has not demonstrated a low level of participation or does not contain a clear and identifiable flaw, and the producer would not significantly benefit from the 508(h) submission;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            |               (iv) The 508(h) submission may create adverse market distortions or adversely impact other crops or agricultural commodities if marketed;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            |               (v) The 508(h) submission will have a significant adverse impact on the private delivery system;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
