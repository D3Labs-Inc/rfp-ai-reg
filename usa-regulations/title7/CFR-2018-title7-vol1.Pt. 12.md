| 1995-01-01 | For purposes of this part, land on which such conversion activities were completed by January 1, 1995, shall be evaluated by the same standards and qualify for the same exemptions as prior-converted croplands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1985-12-23 | However, no action can be taken to increase effects on the water regime beyond that which existed on such lands on or before December 23, 1985, unless NRCS determines the effect on losing remaining wetland values would be minimal under &#167;&#8201;12.5(b)(1)(v).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1985-12-23 | If, after December 23, 1985, changes due to human activity occurred in the watershed and resulted in an increase in the water regime on a person's land, the person may be allowed to adjust the existing drainage system to accommodate the increased water regime on the condition that the person affected by this additional water provides NRCS with appropriate documentation of the increased water regime, the causes thereof, and the planned changes in the existing drainage system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
