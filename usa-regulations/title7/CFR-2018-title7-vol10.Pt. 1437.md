| 2014-02-07 | (c) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, during the first 4 crop years of planting, as determined by the Secretary, native sod acreage in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota that has been tilled for the production of an annual crop after February 7, 2014, will be subject to the following:                                                                                                                                   |
|            |                 (1) The approved yield will be determined by using a yield equal to 65 percent of the producer's T-yield for the annually planted crop; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
