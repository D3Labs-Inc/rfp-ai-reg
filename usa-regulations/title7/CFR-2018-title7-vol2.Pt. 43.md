## Constraints

|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| equal to      | Lots having a quality level  equal to a specified AQL will be accepted approximately 95                   |
| maximum       | number in a sampling plan that indicates the maximum number of defects or defectives permitted in a       |
| more than     | A unit may contain  more than  one defect.                                                                |

| minimum       | number in a sampling plan that indicates the minimum number of defects or defectives permitted in a       |
| greater       | plans having a sample size of 66 or greater and an acceptance number of 1 are not                         |
| prior to      | Some of the factors that must be considered prior to selecting the AQL's are: (1) Class of defects        |
| prior to      | Some of the factors that may be considered prior to selecting the sampling plans for given lot sizes      |
| lesser        | passing &#8220;bad&#8221; lots that are small or of lesser value than they would for larger more valuable |
