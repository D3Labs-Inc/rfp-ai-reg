 Education. PART 6â€”INVENTIONS AND PATENTS (GENERAL)


# ID

 CFR-2018-title34-vol1.Pt. 6


# Summary

(c) To establish a procedure, consistent with pertinent statutes, Executive orders and general Government regulations, for the determination of rights and obligations relating to the patenting of inventions.
This availability can generally be adequately preserved by the dedication of a Government-owned invention to the public.
Determinations to file a domestic patent application on inventions in which the Department has an interest will be made where the circumstances indicate that this is desirable in the public interest, and if it is practicable to do so.
Department determinations not to apply for a domestic patent on employee inventions are subject to review and approval by the Commissioner of Patents.
Except where deemed necessary for protecting the patent claim, the fact that a patent application has been or may be filed will not require any departure from normal policy regarding the dissemination of the results of Department research.
(a) Licenses to practice inventions covered by patents and pending patent applications owned by the U.S. Government as represented by this Department will generally be royalty free, revocable and nonexclusive.
Central files and records shall be maintained of all inventions, patents, and licenses in which the Department has an interest, together with a record of all licenses issued by the Department under such patents.
