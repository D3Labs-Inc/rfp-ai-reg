| (300.0, 'USD')     | (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an institution may provide additional FWS funding to a student whose need has been met until that student's cumulative earnings from all need-based employment occurring subsequent to the time his or her financial need has been met exceed $300.                                                          |
