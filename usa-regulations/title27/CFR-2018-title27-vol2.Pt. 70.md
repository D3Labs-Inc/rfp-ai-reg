| 1 day       | For example, if on the first day of the month a delinquent taxpayer sold personal property subject to an agreement that the buyer remit the purchase price on the last day of the month, a levy made on the buyer on the 10th day of the month would reach the amount due on the sale, although the buyer need not satisfy the levy by paying over the amount to the appropriate TTB officer until the last day of the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 30.0 day    | If the seller fails to hold the proceeds of the sale in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and if the appropriate TTB officer asserts a claim to the proceeds within 30 days after the date of sale, the seller shall be personally liable to the United States for an amount equal to the value of the interest of the United States in the fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25.0 day    | In the event the appropriate TTB officer gives notification that the notice of sale is inadequate, a notice complying with the provisions of this section (including the requirement that the notice be given not less than 25 days prior to the sale in the case of a notice described in paragraph (a) of this section) must be given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 25.0 day    | However, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in such a case the appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, consent to the sale of the property free of the lien or title of the United States even though notice of the sale is given less than 25 days prior to the sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5.0 day     | In any case where the person who submitted a timely notice which indicates the person's name and address does not receive, more than 5 days prior to the date of the sale, written notification from the appropriate TTB officer that the notice is inadequate, the notice shall be considered adequate for purposes of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15.0 day    | Unless the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest furnishes the written itemized statement within 15 days after the request is made by the appropriate TTB officer, it shall be presumed that no amount is payable for expenses in excess of income and the Bureau shall tender only the amount otherwise payable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15.0 day    | If a purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest has failed to furnish the written itemized statement within 15 days after the request therefor is made by the appropriate TTB officer, or there is a disagreement as to the amount properly payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, a payment for excess expenses shall be made after the redemption within a reasonable time following the verification by the appropriate TTB officer of a written itemized statement submitted by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest or the resolution of the disagreement as to the amount properly payable for excess expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1982-12-31 | (b) Applicability to unpaid amounts on December 31, 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1982-12-31 | The unpaid interest (or other amount) that shall be compounded daily includes the interest (or other amount) accrued but unpaid on December 31, 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 6161-01-01 | A failure to pay will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent that the taxpayer has made a satisfactory showing that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of the tax liability and was nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would suffer an undue hardship (as described in 26 CFR 1.6161-1(b)) if paid on the due date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
