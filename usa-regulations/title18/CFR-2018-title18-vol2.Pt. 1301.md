| (5000.0, 'USD') | (d) If TVA deems it warranted by the nature of identification presented, the subject matter of the material to be disclosed, or other reasons found by TVA to be sufficient, TVA may require the individual requesting access to sign a statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.                                                                                           |
| (5000.0, 'USD') | (e) Where TVA is requested to provide access to records by mailing copies of records to the requester, the request shall contain or be accompanied by adequate identifying information to make it likely the requester is the person he purports to be and a notarized statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.                                                            |
